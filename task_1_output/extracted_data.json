    "defined_benefit_vs_contribution": "Defined benefit plans often count your years of service in order to determine whether you\nhave earned a benefit and to calculate how much you will receive in benefits at retirement .\nEmployees in the plan who work part time, but who work 1,000 hours or more each year, must be\ncredited with a portion of the benefit in proportion to what they would have earned if they were\nemployed full time. In a defined contribution plan, your benefit accrual is the amount of\ncontributions and earnings that have accumulated in your 401(k) or other retirement plan\naccount, minus any fees charged to your account by your plan.\nSpecial rules for when you begin to accumulate benefits may apply to certain types of\nretirement plans. For example, in a Simplifed Employee Pension (SEP) Plan, all participants\nwho earn at least $650 a year from their employers are entitled to receive a contribution.\nC\nAN A PLAN REDUCE PROMISED BENEFITS\n?\nDefined benefit plans may change the rate at which you earn future benefits but cannot\nreduce the amount of benefits you have already accumulated. For example, a plan that accrues\nbenefits at the rate of $5 a month for years of service through 2021 may be amended to\nprovide that for years of service beginning in 2022, benefits will be credited at the rate of $4 per\nmonth. Plans that make a significant reduction in the rate at which benefits accumulate must\nprovide you with written notice generally at least 45 days before the change goes into effect.\nIn most situations, if a company terminates a defined benefit plan that does not h ave\nenough funding to pay all of the promised benefits, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\n(PBGC) will pay plan participants and beneficiaries some retirement benefits, but possibly l ess\nthan the promised benefits. (For more information, see the PBGC\u2019s website.)\nIn a defined contribution plan, the employer can change the amount of emplo yer\ncontributions in the future. The employer may also stop contributing for a few years or\nindefinitely depending on the plan terms.\nAn employer can terminate a defined benefit or a defined contribution plan, but cannot\nreduce the benefit you have already accrued.\nH ?\nOW SOON DO YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO YOUR ACCUMULATED BENEFITS\nYou immediately vest in your own contributions and the earnings on them. This means you\nhave earned the right to these amounts without the risk of forfeiting them. But note \u2013 there\nare restrictions on actually taking them out of the plan. See the discussion on the rules for\ndistributions later in this publication.\nHowever, you do not necessarily have an immediate right to any contributions made by\nyour employer. Federal law provides a maximum number of years a company may require\nemployees to work to earn the vested right to all or some of these benefits. ( See tables on\npages 8-9 showing the vesting rules.)\nIn a defined benefit plan, an employer can require that employees have 5 years of service in\norder to become 100 percent vested in the employer-funded benefits (called cliff vestin g).\nEmployers also can choose a graduated vesting schedule, which requires an employee to work\n7 years in order to be 100 percent vested, but provides at least 20 percent vesting after 3 years, 40\npercent after 4 years, 60 percent after 5 years, and 80 percent after 6 years of service. The\npermitted vesting schedules for current defined benefit plans are shown in Table 3 on page 9.\nPlans may provide a different schedule as long as it is more generous than these vesting\n6\nschedules. (Unlike most defined benefit plans, in a cash balance plan, employees vest in\nemployer contributions after 3 years.)\nIn a defined contribution plan such as a 401(k) plan, you are always 100 percent vested\nin your own contributions and any subsequent earnings from your contributions.\nHowever, in most defined contribution plans, you may have to work several years before you\nare vested in the employer\u2019s matching contributions. (There are exceptions, such as the\nSIMPLE 401(k) and safe harbor 401(k), in which you are immediately vested in all required\nemployer contributions. You also vest immediately in the SIMPLE IRA and the SEP.)\nCurrently, employers have a choice of two different vesting schedules for employer matching\n401(k) contributions, which are shown in Table 2 on page 8. Your employer may use a cliff vesting\nschedule in which employees are 100 percent vested in employer contributions after 3 years of\nservice. Under a graduated vesting schedule, an employee must be at least 20 percent vested\nafter 2 years, 40 percent after 3 years, 60 percent after 4 years, 80 percent after 5 years, and 100\npercent after 6 years. If your automatic enrollment 401(k) plan requires employer contributions,\nyou vest in those contributions after 2 years. Automatic enrollment 401(k) plans with optional\nmatching contributions follow one of the vesting schedules noted above.\nEmployers making other contributions to defned contribution plans, such as a 401(k) plan,\nalso can choose between the graduated and cliff vesting schedules. For those contributions\nmade since 2007, they can choose between the schedules in Table 2. For contributions made\nprior to 2007, they can choose between the schedules provided in Table 3.\nYou may lose some of the employer-provided benefits you have earned if you leave\nyour job before you have worked long enough to be vested. However, once vested, you\nhave the right to receive the vested portion of your benefits even if you leave your job before\nretirement. But even though you have the right to certain benefits, your defined contribution\nplan account value could decrease as a result of investment performance after you leave\nyour job.\nNOTE\nIf you leave your company and return, you may be able to count your earlier period\nof employment towards the years of service needed to vest in the employer-provided\nbenefits. Unless your break in service with the company was 5 years or a time equal to the\nlength of your pre-break employment, whichever is longer, you likely can count that time\nprior to your break. Because these rules are very specific, you should read your plan\ndocument carefully if you are contemplating a short-term break from your employer, and\nthen discuss it with your plan administrator. If you left employment before Janu ary 1,\n1985, different rules apply. For more information, contact the Department of Labor\nelectronically or by calling toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nFor Reserve and National Guard units called to active duty, the Uniformed Services\nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) requires that the period of military duty\nbe counted as covered service with the employer for eligibility, vesting, and benefit\naccrual purposes. Returning service members are treated as if they had been continuously\nemployed regardless of the type of retirement plan the employer has adopted. However, a\nperson who is reemployed is entitled to accrued benefits resulting from employee\ncontributions only to the extent they actually make the contributions to the plan.\n7\nVesting Rules\nGenerally, an employer must count your years of service for vesting credit starting with your\ndate of employment. Two exceptions provide that your employer can start counting your\nyears of service with the frst plan year following (1) your 18th birthday if you were under 18\nyears of age when you started working there, and (2) the date you start contributing to a 401(k)\nplan if you elected not to contribute when you were frst eligible.\nPlans can allow employees the right to employer-provided benefts sooner than indicated in\nthe following tables.\nM V R U ERISA\nINIMUM ESTING EQUIREMENTS NDER\nE C\nMPLOYER ONTRIBUTIONS\n(U T E D Y L E )\nSE ABLE IN FFECT ON ATE OU EFT MPLOYER\nTable 2 below shows the current vesting schedules, as of 2002, for employer matching 401(k)\nplan contributions, and for other employer contributions to a defned contribution plan as of\n2007.\nTABLE 2: Effective Date 1/01/02 - Present \u2014\nfor 401(k) Matching Contributions\nEffective Date 1/01/07 \u2013 Present \u2014\nfor Other Defined Contribution\nEmployer Contributions\nGRADUATED VESTING\nYears of Service Non-forfeitable Percentage\n2 20%\n3 40%\n4 60%\n5 80%\n6 100%\nCliff Vesting\nLess than 3 years of service - 0% Vested\nAt least 3 years of service - 100% Vested\nTable 3 is for employees in a defned beneft plan.

You can request this information from\nyour plan administrator, the person who is in charge of running the plan. Your employer\ncan tell you how to contact your plan administrator.\nI\nNFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE RETIREMENT PLAN\nEach retirement plan must have a formal, written plan document that details how it\noperates and its requirements. As noted previously, there is also a booklet that describes\nthe key plan rules, called the Summary Plan Description (SPD), which should be much\neasier to read and understand. The SPD also should include a summary of any material\nchanges to the plan or to the information required to be in the SPD. You can start with\nthe SPD and then look at the plan document if you still have questions.\nIn addition, plans must provide you with a number of notices. Some of the key notices\nare described in Table 5 on page 12.\nFor example, defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans, generally must provide\nadvance notice to employees when a \u201cblackout period\u201d occurs. A blackout period is when\na participant\u2019s right to direct investments, take loans, or obtain distributions is suspended\nfor a period of at least three consecutive business days. Blackout periods often occur\nwhen plans change recordkeepers or investment options.\nSome plan information, such as the Summary Plan Description, must be provided to\nyou automatically and without charge at the times indicated below. You may request a\nSummary Plan Description at other times, but your employer might charge you a copying\nfee. You must ask the plan if you want other information, such as a copy of the written\nplan document or the plan\u2019s Form 5500 annual financial report, and you may have to pay\na copying fee. See Table 5 on page 12 and Table 6 on page 14. Many employers provide\nbenefit information on their websites.\nThe plan\u2019s annual financial report (Form 5500) is also available. You can find the report\nonline or by contacting the U.S. Department of Labor, EBSA Public Disclosure Facility,\nRoom N-1515, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20210, telephone:\n(202) 693-8673. There is a copying fee if the report is over 100 pages. If your plan\nadministrator does not provide you, as a participant covered under the plan, with a\ncopy of the Summary Plan Description automatically or after you request it, you may\ncontact the Department of Labor electronically or by calling toll free 1-866-444-3272 for\nhelp.\n11\nTABLE 5: K I Y P A M P A\nEY NFORMATION OUR LAN DMINISTRATOR UST ROVIDE UTOMATICALLY\nWhat Description When\nSummary Plan A summary version of the plan Within 90 days of becoming a\nDescription (SPD) document and other important participant in the plan; and\nplan information, in easier-to- An updated copy every 10\nunderstand language. years (5 years if the plan has\nbeen amended).\nAutomatic A description of the automatic Generally, at least 30 days\nenrollment process, the before you are eligible to\nEnrollment Notice\npercentage of salary being participate; and\ndeferred, the default At least 30 days before the\ninvestment used for automatic beginning of each subsequent\ncontributions, your right to plan year.\nopt out of the plan, your right\nto change deferral percentage\nand investments, and how to\nfnd information about the\nplan\u2019s other investments.\nIndividual Benefit A statement providing At least quarterly for\nStatement information about your participant-directed defned\naccount balance and vested contribution plans;\nbenefts.

You will also receive an annual notice of the plan\u2019s funding status.\nDefned contribution plans, including 401(k) plans, also must send participants individual\nbeneft statements either quarterly, if participants direct the investments of their accounts,\nor annually, if they do not.

Federal law provides guidelines, shown in Table 7 below, for when plans\nmust start paying retirement benefts.\n2. Plans can choose to start paying benefts sooner. The plan documents will\nstate when you may begin receiving payments from your plan.\n3. You must fle a claim for benefts for your payments to begin. This takes\nsome time for administrative reasons. (See Chapter 6.)\nTABLE 7: Requirements Under Federal Law for Payment of Retirement Benefits\nUnder Federal law, your plan must allow you to begin receiving benefts*\nthe later of -\nOr - Or -\nReaching age 65 or the age your plan considers to 10 years of Terminating your\nbe normal retirement age (if earlier) service service with the\nemployer\n*For administrative reasons, benefts do not begin immediately after meeting these\nconditions. At a minimum, your plan must provide that you will start receiving benefts\nwithin 60 days after the end of the plan year in which you satisfy the conditions. Also, you\nneed to fle a claim under your plan\u2019s procedures. (See Chapter 6.)\nUnder certain circumstances, your beneft payments may be suspended if you continue\nto work beyond normal retirement age. The plan must notify you of the suspension\nduring the frst calendar month or payroll period in which it withholds payments. This\ninformation also should be included in the Summary Plan Description. A plan must advise\nyou of its procedures to request an advance determination of whether a particular type\nof reemployment would result in a suspension of beneft payments. If you are a retiree\nand are considering taking a job, you may wish to write to your plan administrator and\nask if your benefts would be suspended.\nTable 7 shows the general requirements for when payments begin. Listed below are\nsome permitted variations:\nAlthough defned beneft plans and money purchase plans generally allow you\nto receive benefts only when you reach the plan\u2019s retirement age, some have\nprovisions for early retirement.\n17\n401(k)plans often allow you to receive your account balance when you leave your job.\n401(k) plans may allow for distributions while still employed if you have reached age\n59\u00bd or if you suffer a hardship.\nProft sharing plans may permit you to receive your vested beneft after a specifc\nnumber of years or whenever you leave your job.\nA phased retirement option allows employees at or near retirement age to reduce\ntheir work hours to part time, receive benefts, and continue to earn additional funds.\nESOPs do not have to pay out any benefts until 1 year after the plan year in which\nyou retire, or as many as 6 years if you leave for reasons other than retirement, death,\nor disability.\nW\nARNING\n1. You may owe current income taxes \u2013 and possibly tax penalties \u2014 on your\ndistribution if you take money out before age 59\u00bd, unless you transfer it to an\nIRA or another tax-qualifed retirement plan.\n2. Taking all or a portion of your funds out of your account before retirement age\nwill mean you have less in retirement benefts.\nW ?\nHEN IS THE LATEST YOU MAY BEGIN TO TAKE PAYMENT OF YOUR BENEFITS\nFederal law sets a mandatory date by which you must start receiving your retirement benefts,\neven if you would like to wait longer. This mandatory start date generally is set to begin on\nApril 1 following the calendar year in which you turn 72 or, if later, when you retire. However,\nyour plan may require you to begin receiving distributions even if you have not retired by age\n72.If you reached age 70\u00bd before 2020, you may have a required minimum distribution for 2021\neven though you\u2019re not yet 72.\nH ?\nOW WILL YOUR BENEFITS BE PAID\nIf you are in a defned beneft or money purchase plan, the plan must offer you a beneft\nin the form of a life annuity, which means that you will receive equal, periodic payments, often\nas a monthly beneft, for the rest of your life. Defned beneft and money purchase plans also\nmay offer other payment options, so check with the plan. If you are in a defned contribution\nplan (other than a money purchase plan), the plan may pay your benefts in a single lump sum\npayment as well as offer other options, including payments over a set period of time (such as\n5 or 10 years) or an annuity with monthly lifetime payments.\nIf you are leaving your employer before retirement age, see the next chapter.\nC ?\nAN A BENEFIT CONTINUE FOR YOUR SPOUSE IF YOU DIE FIRST\nIn a defned beneft or money purchase plan, unless you and your spouse choose otherwise,\nthe form of payment will include a survivor\u2019s beneft. This survivor\u2019s beneft, called a qualifed\njoint and survivor annuity (QJSA), will provide payments over your lifetime and your spouse\u2019s\nlifetime. The beneft payment that your surviving spouse receives must be at least half of the\nbeneft payment you received during your joint lives. While the survivor\u2019s beneft is typically\n50 percent, some plans provide for other options, such as 75 percent. Note that your monthly\nbeneft payments will be reduced because the beneft payments will continue for your spouse\u2019s\nlife if you die frst.\n18\nIf you choose not to receive the survivor\u2019s beneft, you will receive benefts for your lifetime\nonly. You must follow specifc rules to waive the survivor beneft. You and your spouse must\nreceive a written explanation of the qualifed joint and survivor annuity. Within certain time\nlimits, you must make a written waiver and your spouse must sign a written consent to the\nalternative payment form without a survivor\u2019s beneft, stating that you both understand that\nbeneft payments will end when you die. A notary or plan representative must witness your\nspouse\u2019s signature.\nIn most 401(k) plans and other defned contribution plans, the plan is written so different\nprotections apply for surviving spouses. In most defned contribution plans, if you die before\nyou receive your benefts, they automatically will go to your surviving spouse. If you wish to\nselect a different benefciary, your spouse must consent by signing a waiver, witnessed by a\nnotary or plan representative.\nIf you were single when you enrolled in the plan and subsequently married, it is important\nthat you notify your employer and/or plan administrator and change your status under the plan.\nIf you do not have a spouse, it is important to name a benefciary.\nIf you or your spouse left employment before January 1, 1985, different rules apply.\nFor more information on these rules, contact the Department of Labor electronically or by\ncalling toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nC\nAN YOU BORROW FROM YOUR\n401(\nK\n)\nPLAN ACCOUNT\n?\n401(k) plans can \u2013 but are not required to \u2013 offer loans to participants. The loans must charge\na reasonable rate of interest and be adequately secured. The plan must include a procedure\nfor applying for the loans and the plan\u2019s policy for granting them. Loan amounts are limited to\nthe lesser of 50 percent of your account balance or $50,000 and must be repaid within 5 years\n(unless the loan is used to purchase a principal residence).\nC AN YOU GET A DISTRIBUTION FROM YOUR PLAN IF YOU ARE NOT YET 65 OR YOUR PLAN \u2019 S\n?\nNORMAL RETIREMENT AGE BUT ARE FACING A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP\nAgain, defned contribution plans can \u2013 but are not required to \u2013 provide distributions in\ncase of hardship. Check your plan booklet to see if your plan does permit them and under\nwhat circumstances.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nFind out when and how you can receive your benefts at retirement.\nFill out the necessary forms to update information with your retirement plan.\nNotify the retirement plan of any change of address or marital status.\nKeep all documents for your records, including Summary Plan Descriptions, company\nmemos, and individual benefit statements.\nFor tax information, look at Internal Revenue Service Publication 575 (Pension\nand Annuity Income).\n19\nC 5: T Y R B W Y\nHAPTER AKING OUR ETIREMENT ENEFIT ITH OU\nIf you leave an employer before you reach retirement age, whether or not you can take\nyour benefts out and/or roll them into another tax-qualifed plan or account will depend\non what type of plan you are in.\nI ,\nF YOU LEAVE BEFORE RETIREMENT CAN YOU TAKE YOUR RETIREMENT BENEFIT WITH\n?\nYOU\nIf you are in a defned beneft plan (other than a cash balance plan), you most likely\nwill have to leave the benefts with the retirement plan until you are eligible to receive\nthem. Therefore, it is very important that you update your personal information with the\nplan administrator regularly and keep current on any changes in your former employer\u2019s\nownership or address.\nIf you are in a cash balance plan, you probably will have the option to transfer at\nleast a portion of your account balance to an individual retirement account or to a new\nemployer\u2019s plan.\nIf you are in a defned contribution plan (such as a 401(k) plan) and you leave your\nemployer before retirement age, in most cases you will be able to transfer your account\nbalance out of your employer\u2019s plan.\nW ?\nHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE FOR TAKING YOUR DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS\nA lump sum \u2013 you can choose to receive your benefts as a single payment from\nyour plan, effectively cashing out your account. You may need to pay income\ntaxes on the amount you receive, and possibly a penalty.\nA rollover to another retirement plan \u2013 you can ask your employer to transfer\nyour account balance directly to your new employer\u2019s plan if it accepts such\ntransfers.\nA rollover to an IRA \u2013 you can ask your employer to transfer your account\nbalance directly to an individual retirement account (IRA).\nIf your account balance is less than $5,000 when you leave the employer,\nthe plan can make an immediate distribution without your consent. If this\ndistribution is more than $1,000, the plan must automatically roll the funds into\nan IRA it selects, unless you decide to receive a lump sum payment or to roll\nit over into an IRA you choose. The plan must frst send you a notice allowing\nyou to make other arrangements, and it must follow rules regarding what type\nof IRA can be used (i.e., it cannot combine the distribution with savings you\nhave deposited directly in an IRA). Rollovers must be made to an entity that is\nqualifed to offer individual retirement plans. Also, the rollover IRA must have\ninvestments designed to preserve principal. The IRA provider may not charge\nmore in fees and expenses for such plans than it would its other individual\nretirement plan customers.\nPlease note: If you choose a lump sum payment and do not transfer the money to\nanother retirement account (employer plan or IRA other than a Roth IRA), you will owe\na tax penalty if you are under age 59\u00bd and do not meet certain exceptions. In addition,\nyou may have less to live on during your retirement. Transferring your retirement plan\naccount balance to another plan or an IRA when you leave your job will protect the tax\nadvantages of your account and preserve the benefts for retirement.\n21\nW ?\nHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LEAVE A JOB AND LATER RETURN\nIf you leave an employer for whom you have worked for several years and later return, you\nmay be able to count those earlier years toward vesting. Generally, a plan must preserve the\nservice credit you have accumulated if you leave your employer and then return within fve\nyears. Service credit refers to the years of service that count towards vesting. Because these\nrules are very specifc, you should read your plan document carefully if you are contemplating\na short-term break from your employer, and then discuss it with your plan administrator. If you\nleft employment prior to January 1, 1985, different rules apply.\nIf you retire and later go back to work for a former employer, you must be allowed to continue\nto accrue additional benefts, subject to a plan limit on the total years of service credited under\nthe plan.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nIf you leave an employer before retirement, fnd out whether you can roll your\nbenefts into a new plan or into an IRA.\nIf you leave your benefits in your former employer\u2019s plan, keep your contact\ninformation up to date with the former employer, and keep track of the employer\u2019s\ncontact information.\nIf you are considering taking your benefts as a lump sum, fnd out what taxes and\npenalties you will owe and plan on how you will replace that income in retirement.\n22\nC 6: F C B\nHAPTER ILING A LAIM FOR ENEFITS\nFederal retirement law requires all plans to have a reasonable written procedure for\nprocessing your benefts claim and appeal if your claim is denied. The Summary Plan\nDescription (SPD) should include your plan\u2019s claims procedures. Usually, you fll out the\nrequired paperwork and submit it to the plan administrator, who then can tell you what\nyour benefts will be and when they will start.\nF C F A\nILING A LAIM AND ILING AN PPEAL\nIf there is a problem or a dispute about whether you qualify for benefts or what\namount you should receive, check your plan\u2019s claims procedure. Federal law outlines the\nfollowing claims procedures requirements:\nOnce you fle your claim, the plan can take up to 90 days to reach a decision,\nor 180 days if it notifes you that it needs an extension.\nIf the plan denies your claim, it must send you a written notice, including specifc\ninformation about why your claim was denied and how to fle an appeal.\nYou have 60 days to request a full and fair review of your denied claim, using\nyour plan\u2019s appeals procedure.\nThe plan can take up to 60 days to review your appeal, as well as an additional\n60 days if it notifes you of the need for an extension. The plan must send a\nwritten notice telling you whether the appeal was granted or denied.\nIf the appeal is denied, the written notice must tell you the reason, describe\nany additional appeal levels, and give you a statement about your rights to seek\njudicial review of the plan\u2019s decision.\nIf the plan denies your appeal and you believe it failed to follow ERISA\u2019s\nrequirements, you may decide to seek legal advice. You also can contact the Department\nof Labor about your rights under ERISA electronically or by calling toll free\n1-866-444-3272.\nFor more information on claims procedures, see the Department of Labor\npublication Filing a Claim for Your Retirement Benefits.

These individuals or groups are called plan\nfduciaries. Fiduciary status is based on the functions that the person performs for the\nplan, not just their title.\nD ?\nOES YOUR PLAN HAVE TO IDENTIFY THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR OPERATING THE PLAN\nA plan must name at least one fduciary in the written plan document, or through a\nprocess described in the plan, as having control over the plan\u2019s operations. This fduciary\ncan be identifed by offce or by name. For some plans, it may be an administrative\ncommittee or the company\u2019s board of directors. Usually, a plan\u2019s fduciaries will include\nthe trustee, investment managers, and the plan administrator. The plan administrator is\nusually the best starting point for questions you might have about the plan.\nW ?\nHAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PLAN FIDUCIARIES\nFiduciaries have important responsibilities and are subject to certain standards of\nconduct because they act on behalf of the participants in the plan. These responsibilities\ninclude:\nActing solely in the interest of plan participants and their benefciaries, with\nthe exclusive purpose of providing benefts to them;\nCarrying out their duties with skill, prudence, and diligence;\nFollowing the plan documents (unless inconsistent with ERISA);\nDiversifying plan investments;\nPaying only reasonable expenses of administering the plan and investing its\nassets; and\nAvoiding conficts of interest.\nThe fduciary also is responsible for selecting the investment providers and the\ninvestment options, and for monitoring their performance. Some plans, such as most 401(k)\nor proft sharing plans, can be set up to permit participants to choose the investments\nin their accounts (within certain investment options provided by the plan). If the plan is\nproperly set up to give participants control over their investments, then the fduciary is\nnot liable for losses resulting from the participant\u2019s investment decisions. Department\nof Labor rules provide guidance to make sure participants have suffcient information on\ntheir investment options so they can make informed decisions. This information includes:\nA description of each investment option, including the investment goals, risk,\nand return characteristics;\nInformation about any designated investment managers;\nAn explanation of when and how to request changes in investments, plus any\nrestrictions on when you can change investments;\n25\nA statement of the fees that may be charged to your account when you change\ninvestment options or buy and sell investments;\nThe name, address, and telephone number of the plan fduciary or other person\ndesignated to provide certain additional information on request; and\nA statement that the plan intends to follow the Department of Labor rules and that\nthe fduciaries may be relieved of liability for losses that are the direct and necessary\nresult of a participant\u2019s investment instructions.\nFor an automatic enrollmen t plan, such as an automatic enrollment 401(k) plan, the plan\nfiduciary selects th e investments for em ployees\u2019 automatic contributions if the employees do\nnot provide direction. If the plan is properly set up, using certain default investments that\ngenerally minimize the risk of large losses and provide long-term growth, and providing notice of\nthe plan\u2019s automatic enrollment process, then the fiduciary may be relieved of liability for\nlosses resulting from investing in these default alternatives. The plan also must provide a br oad\nrange of investments for participants to choose from and information on those investments so\nparticipants can make informed decisions. Department of Labor rules provide guidance on the\ndefault investment alternatives that can be used and the notice and information participants\nmust receive.\nW ?\nHAT IF A PLAN FIDUCIARY FAILS TO CARRY OUT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES\nFiduciaries that do not follow the required standards of conduct may be personally lia ble.\nIf the plan loses money because of a breach of their duties, fiduciaries would have to restore\nthose losses, or any profits received through their improper actions. For example, if an emplo yer\ndoes not forward participants\u2019 401(k) contributions to the plan, they would have to pay back the\ncontributions to the plan as well as any lost earnings, and return any profits they improperly\nreceived. Fiduciaries also can be removed from their positions as fiduciaries if they fail to fol low\nthe standards of conduct.\nW ?\nHEN DOES THE EMPLOYER NEED TO DEPOSIT EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE PLAN\nIf you contribute to your retirement plan through deductions from your paycheck, then the\nemployer must follow certain rules to make sure that it deposits the contributions in a timely\nmanner. The law says that the employer must deposit participant contributions as soon as it\nis reasonably possible to separate them from the company\u2019s assets, but no later than the 15th\nbusiness day of the month following the payday. For small plans (those with fewer than 100\nparticipants), salary reduction contributions deposited with the plan no later than the 7th business day\nfollowing withholding by the employer will be considered contributed in compliance with\nthe law. In the Annual Report (Form 5500), the plan administrator must include information on\nwhether deposits of contributions were made on a timely basis. For more information, see\nthe Department of Labor\u2019s Ten Warning Signs That Your 401(k) Contributions Are Being\nMisused for indicators of possible delays in depositing contributions.\n26\nW \u2019\nHAT ARE THE PLAN FIDUCIARIES OBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE FEES AND EXPENSES PAID BY\n? C ?\nTHE PLAN AN THE PLAN CHARGE MY DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN ACCOUNT FOR FEES\nPlan fduciaries have to consider the fees and expenses paid by your plan for its operations.\nERISA\u2019s fduciary standards, discussed above, mean that fduciaries must:\nEstablish a prudent process for selecting investment alternatives and service providers\nto the plan;\nEnsure that fees paid to service providers and other plan expenses are reasonable in\nlight of the level and quality of services provided;\nSelect prudent and adequately diversifed investment alternatives; and\nMonitor investment alternatives and service providers to see that they continue to be\nappropriate choices.\nThe plan may deduct plan administration and investment fees from your defined\ncontribution plan account, either as a direct charge or indirectly as a reduction of your\naccount\u2019s investment returns. Fees for individual services, such as for processing a loan from\nthe plan or a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (see Chapter 9), also may be charged to\nyour account.\nIf you direct the investments in your account, your plan will provide information about\nyour rights and responsibilities under the plan related to directing them. This includes\nplan and investment-related information, including information about fees and expenses,\nthat you need to make informed decisions about the management of your account. The\ninvestment-related information is provided in a format, such as a chart, that allows for a\ncomparison among the plan\u2019s investment options. The plan should provide this\ninformation before you can direct investments for the first time and annually thereafter\nwith information on the fees and expenses actually paid provided at least quarterly.\nFor more information, see the Department of Labor brochure A Look at 401(k) Plan\nFees. To obtain a copy, contact the Department of Labor electronically or call toll free at\n1-866-444-3272.\nA I\nCTION TEM\nIf you have any questions about the management of the plan and its assets, contact\nyour plan administrator.\n27\nC 8: Y B D P T\nHAPTER OUR ENEFIT URING A LAN ERMINATION\nC M\nOR OMPANY ERGER\nAs noted at the beginning of this booklet, employers are not required to offer a\nretirement plan, and they can modify and/or terminate plans.\nW ?\nHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PLAN IS TERMINATED\nFederal law provides some measures to protect employees who participated in\nplans that are terminated, both defined benefit and defined contribution. When a plan\nis terminated, the current employees must become 100 percent vested in their\naccrued benefits. This means you have a right to all the benefits that you have earned\nat the time of plan termination, even benefits in which you were not vested and\nwould have lost if you had left the employer. If there is a partial termination of a\nplan (for example, if your employer closes a particular plant or division that results in\nthe end of employment of a substantial percentage of plan participants), the affected\nemployees must be immediately 100 percent vested to the extent the plan is funded.\nW\nHAT IF YOUR TERMINATED DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY\n?\nTO PAY THE BENEFITS\nThe Federal Government, through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\n(PBGC), insures most private defined benefit plans. For terminated defined benefit\nplans that do not have enough money to pay all of the benefits, the PBGC will\nguarantee the payment of your vested pension benefits up to the limits set by law. For\nfurther information on plan termination guarantees, contact the Pension Benefit\nGuaranty Corporation toll free at 1-800-400-7242, or visit the website.\nW ?\nHAT HAPPENS IF A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN IS TERMINATED\nThe PBGC does not guarantee benefits for defined contribution plans. If you are\nin a defined contribution plan that is in the process of terminating, the plan fiduciaries\nand trustees should maintain the plan until they terminate it and pay out the assets.\nI ?\nS YOUR ACCRUED BENEFIT PROTECTED IF YOUR PLAN MERGES WITH ANOTHER PLAN\nYour plan rules and investment choices likely will change if your company merges\nwith another. Your employer may choose to merge your plan with another plan. If your\nplan is terminated because of the merger, the benefits that you have accrued cannot be\nreduced. You must receive a benefit that is at least equal to what you were entitled to\nbefore the merger. In a defined contribution plan, the value of your account may still\nfluctuate after the merger based on investment performance.\nSpecial rules apply to mergers of multiemployer defined benefit plans, which\ngenerally are under the jurisdiction of the PBGC. Contact the PBGC for further\ninformation.\nW ?\nHAT IF YOUR EMPLOYER GOES BANKRUPT\nGenerally, your retirement assets should not be at risk if your employer declares\nbankruptcy. Federal law requires that retirement plans fund promised benefits\nadequately and keep plan assets separate from the employer\u2019s business assets. The\nfunds must be held in trust or invested in an insurance contract. The employers\u2019\n29\ncreditors cannot make a claim on retirement plan funds. However, you should confirm that\nany contributions your employer deducts from your paycheck are forwarded to the plan\u2019s\ntrust or insurance contract in a timely manner.\nSignificant business events such as bankruptcies, mergers, and acquisitions can result\nin employers abandoning their individual account plans (e.g., 401(k) plans), leaving no\nplan fiduciary to manage it. In this situation, participants often have difficulty in accessing\ntheir earned benefits and have no one to contact with questions. Custodians such as banks,\ninsurers, and mutual fund companies are left holding the assets of these plans but do not\nhave the authority to terminate the plans and distribute the assets. In response, the\nDepartment of Labor issued rules to create a voluntary process for the custodian to wind\nup the plan\u2019s business so that benefit distributions can be made and the plan\nterminated. Information about this program can be found on the Department of Labor\u2019s\nwebsite.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nIf your former employer has gone out of business, arrangements should have been\nmade so a plan official remains responsible for the payment of benefits and other\nplan business. If you are entitled to benefits and are unable to contact the plan\nadministrator, contact EBSA electronically or by calling toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nKeep a file with information on your plan and company. If the company no longer\nexists under its former name, you might find some information on the Internet by\nentering the former name in a search engine. If your plan is abandoned, use the\nsearch function on the EBSA website to find out if the plan\u2019s custodian is terminating\nthe plan and the custodian\u2019s co ntact information.\nIf your plan merges, make sure you read the communications about changes in your\nplan, including changes in benefits and investment choices.\nIf your retirement benefit remains with a former employer, keep current on any\nchanges your former employer makes, including changes of address, mergers, or\nemployer name.\nIf you move, give the plan your new contact information.\n30\nC 9: P C A Y B\nHAPTER OTENTIAL LAIMS GAINST OUR ENEFIT\n(D )\nIVORCE\nYour retirement plan generally is safe from claims by other people. Creditors to\nwhom you owe money cannot make a claim against your funds in a retirement plan. For\nexample, if you leave your employer and transfer your 401(k) account into an individual\nretirement account (IRA), creditors generally cannot get access to those IRA funds even\nif you declare bankruptcy.\nFederal law does make an exception for family support and the division of property\nat divorce. For many workers, retirement savings is one of their most signifcant assets.\nFor this reason, whether and how to divide a participant\u2019s interest in a retirement plan\nare often important considerations in separation, divorce, and other domestic relations\nproceedings. While state domestic relations law generally governs the division of marital\nproperty, any assignments of retirement benefts also must comply with Federal law,\nspecifcally ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.\nA state court can award part or all of a participant\u2019s retirement beneft to the spouse,\nformer spouse, child, or other dependent. The recipient named in the order is called\nthe alternate payee. The court issues a specifc order, called a domestic relations order,\nwhich can be in the form of a state court judgment, decree or order, or court approval\nof a property settlement agreement. The order must relate to child support, alimony, or\nmarital property rights, and must be made under state domestic relations law.\nThe plan administrator determines if the order is a qualifed domestic relations order\n(QDRO) under the plan\u2019s procedures and then notifes the participant and the alternate\npayee.\nTo be a QDRO, the order must contain the following information:\nThe participant\u2019s name and last known mailing address;\nThe name and last known mailing address of each alternate payee;\nThe name of the plan;\nThe amount, percentage, or method of determining the amount or percentage of\nthe beneft to be paid to the alternate payee, and\nThe number of payments or time period to which the order applies.\nThe specific content of the rest of the order will depend on the type of retirement\nplan, the nature of the participant\u2019s benefits, the purpose for issuing the order, and the\nintent of the parties drafting the order . A QDRO must provide for a type or form of bene fit\nthat the plan already allows. It cannot require the plan to provide increased benefits. In\ngeneral, a QDRO may assign survivor benefits to a former spouse. Participants and\nalternate payees drafting a QDRO should read the plan\u2019s summary plan description and\nother plan documents to understand the survivor benefits available under the plan. A\nQDRO cannot require a plan to pay benefits to an alternate payee that, under a QDRO\npreviously recognized by the plan, must be paid to another alternate payee.\nIf the participant is still employed, a QDRO can require payment to the alternate payee to\nbegin on or after the participant\u2019s earliest possible retirement age under the plan.\nThese rules apply to both defined benefit and defined contribution plan s.\nFor additional information, see EBSA\u2019s publication, QDROs \u2013 The Division of Retireme nt\n31\nBenefits Through Qualified Domestic Relations Orders.

The contributions go into a 401(k) account, with the\nemployee often choosing the investments based on options provided under the p lan.\nIn some plans, the employer also contributes, matching the employee\u2019s contributions up\nto a certain percentage. SIMPLE and safe harbor 401(k) plans have additional employer\ncontribution and vesting requirements.\nAutomatic Enrollment \u2013 Employers can automatically enroll employees in a plan, suc h as a\n401(k) or SIMPLE IRA plan, and place contributions deducted from employees\u2019 paycheck s into\ncertain predetermined investments, unless the employees decide otherwise. Participants can\nopt out of participation and have periodic opportunities to change their investments\n(or in a SIMPLE IRA, the financial institution where the contributions are invested).\nBenefit Accrual \u2013 The amount of benefits accumulated under the plan.\nCash Balance Plan \u2013 A type of defined benefit plan that includes some elements that are\nsimilar to a defined contribution plan because the benefit amount is computed based on\na formula using contribution and earning credits, and each participant has a hypothetical\naccount. Cash balance plans are more likely than traditional defined benefit plans to\nmake lump sum distributions. (For more information, see Cash Balance Pension Pl ans:\nQuestions and Answers.)\nDefined Benefit Pl an \u2013 This type of plan, also known as the traditional pension plan,\npromises the participant a specified monthly benefit at retirement. The benefit often is\nbased on factors such a s your salary, your age, and the number of years you worked for the\nemployer.\nDefined Contribution Plan \u2013 In a defined contribution plan, the employee and/or the\nemployer contribute to the employee\u2019s individual plan account. The employee often decides\nhow their account is invested. The value of the account will change based on the value and\nperformance of the investments. The amount in the account at distribution includes the\ncontributions and investment gains or losses, minus any investment and administrative fees.\nThe contributions and earnings are not taxed until distribution.\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) \u2013 A Federal law that sets\ns tandards of protection for individuals in most voluntarily established, private-sector\nretirement plans. ERISA:\nRequires plans to provide plan information to participants, including important facts\nabout plan features and funding;\nSets minimum standards for participation, vesting, benefit accrual, and funding;\nProvides fiduciary responsibilities for those who manage and control plan assets;\nRequires plans to establish a claims and appeals process for participants to\nget benefits from their plans;\n35\nGives participants the right to sue for benefts and breaches of fduciary duty; and,\nIf a defned beneft plan is terminated, guarantees payment of certain benefts through\na Federally chartered corporation, known as the Pension Beneft Guaranty Corporation\n(PBGC).\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) \u2013 A type of defned contribution plan that is invested\nprimarily in employer stock.\nIndividual Beneft Statement \u2013 An individual beneft statement provides information about\na participant\u2019s retirement benefts, such as the total plan benefts earned and vested benefts,\non a periodic basis. Additional information may be included depending upon the type of plan,\nsuch as how a participant\u2019s 401(k) plan account is invested and the value of those investments.\nIndividual Retirement Account (IRA) \u2013 An individual account set up with a fnancial institution,\nsuch as a bank or a mutual fund company. Under Federal law, individuals may set aside personal\nsavings up to a certain amount, and the investments grow, tax deferred. In addition, defned\ncontribution plan participants can transfer money from an employer retirement plan to an IRA\nwhen leaving an employer. IRAs can be part of an employer plan.\nMoney Purchase Plan \u2013 A money purchase plan requires set annual contributions from the\nemployer to individual accounts and is subject to other rules.\nMultiemployer Plan \u2013 A retirement plan sponsored by several employers under collective\nbargaining agreements that meets certain other requirements. A participant who changes jobs\nfrom one sponsoring employer to another stays in the same plan.\nPlan Administrator \u2013 The person identifed in the plan document as having responsibility for\nrunning the plan. It could be the employer, a committee of employees, a company executive,\nor someone hired for that purpose.\nPlan Document \u2013 A written instrument under which the plan is established and operated.\nPlan Fiduciary \u2013 Anyone who exercises discretionary authority or discretionary control over\nmanagement or administration of the plan, exercises any authority or control over management\nor disposition of plan assets, or gives investment advice about plan assets for a fee or other\ncompensation.\nPlan Trustee \u2013 Someone who has the exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control\nthe assets of the plan. The trustee can be subject to the direction of a named fduciary and the\nnamed fduciary can appoint one or more investment managers for the plan\u2019s assets.\nPlan Year \u2013 A 12-month period designated by a retirement plan for calculating vesting and\ndistribution, among other things. The plan year can be the calendar year or an alternative\nperiod, e.g., July 1 to June 30.\n36\nProft Sharing Plan \u2013 A proft sharing plan allows the employer each year to determine how\nmuch to contribute to the plan (out of profts or otherwise) in cash or employer stock. The plan\ncontains a formula for allocating the annual contribution among participants.\nRollover \u2013 A rollover occurs when a participant leaves an employer and directs the defned\ncontribution plan to transfer the money in their account to a new plan or individual retirement\naccount. This preserves the benefts and does not trigger any tax consequences if done in a\ntimely manner.\nSafe Harbor 401(k) \u2013 A safe harbor 401(k) is similar to a traditional 401(k) plan, but the\nemployer is required to make contributions for each employee. The employer contributions\nin safe harbor 401(k) plans are immediately 100 percent vested. The safe harbor 401(k) eases\nadministrative burdens on employers by eliminating some of the complex tax rules ordinarily\napplied to traditional 401(k) plans.\nSavings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers (SIMPLE) \u2013 A plan in\nwhich a small business with 100 or fewer employees can offer retirement benefts through\nemployee salary reductions and matching contributions (similar to a 401(k) plan). It can be\neither a SIMPLE IRA or a SIMPLE 401(k). SIMPLE IRA plans impose few administrative burdens\non employers because employees own the IRAs, and the bank or fnancial institution receiving\nthe funds does most of the paperwork. While each has some different features, including\ncontribution limits and the availability of loans, required employer contributions are immediately\n100 percent vested in both.\nSimplifed Employee Pension (SEP) Plan \u2013 A plan in which the employer makes contributions\non a tax-favored basis to employee-owned individual retirement accounts (IRAs). If certain\nconditions are met, the employer is not subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements\nof most retirement plans. Under a SEP, an IRA is set up by or for an employee to accept the\nemployer\u2019s contributions.\nSummary Plan Description \u2013 A document provided by the plan administrator that includes\na plain-language description of important features of the plan, such as:\nWhen employees begin to participate in the plan,\nHow service and benefts are calculated,\nWhen benefts become vested,\nWhen and how payment is received, and\nHow to fle a claim for benefts.\nParticipants must be informed of material changes either through a revised Summary Plan\nDescription or in a separate document called a Summary of Material Modifcations.\nVested Benefts \u2013 Those benefts that the individual has earned a right to receive and that\ncannot be forfeited.\nYears of Service \u2013 The time an individual has worked in a job covered by the plan.

Plan rules can vary\nas long as they meet the requirements under Federal law. You need to check with your plan\nor review the plan booklet (called the Summary Plan Description) to learn your plan\u2019s rules\nand requirements. Your plan may require you to work for the company for a period of time\nbefore you can participate in the plan. In addition, there typically is a time frame to begin to\naccumulate benefts and earn the right to them (sometimes referred to as \u201cvesting\u201d).\nW \u2019 ?\nHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN YOUR EMPLOYER S RETIREMENT PLAN\nFind out if you are within the group of employees covered by your employer\u2019s retirement\nplan. Federal law allows employers to include certain groups of employees and exclude\nothers from a retirement plan. For example, your employer may sponsor one plan for salaried\nemployees and another for union employees. Part-time employees may be eligible if they work\nat least 1,000 hours per year, which is about 20 hours per week. So if you work part time, fnd\nout if you are covered.\nW ?\nHEN CAN YOUR PARTICIPATION BEGIN\nOnce you know you are covered, you need to fnd out when you can begin to participate\nin the plan. You can fnd this information in your plan\u2019s Summary Plan Description. Federal\nlaw sets minimum requirements, but a plan may be more generous. Generally, a plan may\nrequire an employee to be at least 21 years old and to have a year of service with the company\nbefore the employee can participate in a plan. However, plans may allow employees to begin\nparticipation before reaching age 21 or completing one year of service. For administrative\nreasons, your participation may be delayed up to 6 months after you meet these age and service\ncriteria or until the start of the next plan year, whichever is sooner. The plan year is the calendar\nyear, or an alternative 12-month period, that a retirement plan uses for plan administration.\nIt is important that you learn the rules for your employer\u2019s plan.\nEmployers can require additional years of service in some circumstances. For example,\nif your plan allows you to vest (discussed in detail later in this chapter) immediately upon\nparticipating in the plan, it may require that you work for the company for two years before\nyou can participate in the plan.\nFederal law also imposes other participation rules for certain circumstances. For example,\nif you were an older worker when you were hired, you cannot be excluded from participating\nin the plan just because you are close to retirement age.\nSome 401(k) plans and SIMPLE IRA plans enroll employees automatically. This means that\nyou will automatically become a participant in the plan unless you choose to opt out. The\nplan will deduct a set contribution level from your paycheck and put it into a predetermined\ninvestment. If your employer has an automatic enrollment plan, you should receive a\nnotice describing the automatic contribution process, when your participation begins, your\nopportunity to opt out of the plan or change your contribution level and where your automatic\ncontributions are invested. If you are in a 401(k), the notice will also describe your right to\nchange investments, or if you are in a SIMPLE IRA plan, your right to change the fnancial\ninstitution where your contributions are invested.\n5\nW ?\nHEN DO YOU BEGIN TO ACCUMULATE BENEFITS\nOnce you begin to participate in a retirement plan, you need to understand how you accrue\nbenefts. Your accrued beneft is the amount of retirement benefts that you have accumulated\nor that have been allocated to you under the plan at any particular point in time.\nDefined benefit plans often count your years of service in order to determine whether you\nhave earned a benefit and to calculate how much you will receive in benefits at retirement .\nEmployees in the plan who work part time, but who work 1,000 hours or more each year, must be\ncredited with a portion of the benefit in proportion to what they would have earned if they were\nemployed full time. In a defined contribution plan, your benefit accrual is the amount of\ncontributions and earnings that have accumulated in your 401(k) or other retirement plan\naccount, minus any fees charged to your account by your plan.\nSpecial rules for when you begin to accumulate benefits may apply to certain types of\nretirement plans. For example, in a Simplifed Employee Pension (SEP) Plan, all participants\nwho earn at least $650 a year from their employers are entitled to receive a contribution.\nC\nAN A PLAN REDUCE PROMISED BENEFITS\n?\nDefined benefit plans may change the rate at which you earn future benefits but cannot\nreduce the amount of benefits you have already accumulated. For example, a plan that accrues\nbenefits at the rate of $5 a month for years of service through 2021 may be amended to\nprovide that for years of service beginning in 2022, benefits will be credited at the rate of $4 per\nmonth. Plans that make a significant reduction in the rate at which benefits accumulate must\nprovide you with written notice generally at least 45 days before the change goes into effect.\nIn most situations, if a company terminates a defined benefit plan that does not h ave\nenough funding to pay all of the promised benefits, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\n(PBGC) will pay plan participants and beneficiaries some retirement benefits, but possibly l ess\nthan the promised benefits. (For more information, see the PBGC\u2019s website.)\nIn a defined contribution plan, the employer can change the amount of emplo yer\ncontributions in the future. The employer may also stop contributing for a few years or\nindefinitely depending on the plan terms.\nAn employer can terminate a defined benefit or a defined contribution plan, but cannot\nreduce the benefit you have already accrued.\nH ?\nOW SOON DO YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO YOUR ACCUMULATED BENEFITS\nYou immediately vest in your own contributions and the earnings on them. This means you\nhave earned the right to these amounts without the risk of forfeiting them. But note \u2013 there\nare restrictions on actually taking them out of the plan. See the discussion on the rules for\ndistributions later in this publication.\nHowever, you do not necessarily have an immediate right to any contributions made by\nyour employer. Federal law provides a maximum number of years a company may require\nemployees to work to earn the vested right to all or some of these benefits. ( See tables on\npages 8-9 showing the vesting rules.)\nIn a defined benefit plan, an employer can require that employees have 5 years of service in\norder to become 100 percent vested in the employer-funded benefits (called cliff vestin g).\nEmployers also can choose a graduated vesting schedule, which requires an employee to work\n7 years in order to be 100 percent vested, but provides at least 20 percent vesting after 3 years, 40\npercent after 4 years, 60 percent after 5 years, and 80 percent after 6 years of service. The\npermitted vesting schedules for current defined benefit plans are shown in Table 3 on page 9.\nPlans may provide a different schedule as long as it is more generous than these vesting\n6\nschedules. (Unlike most defined benefit plans, in a cash balance plan, employees vest in\nemployer contributions after 3 years.)\nIn a defined contribution plan such as a 401(k) plan, you are always 100 percent vested\nin your own contributions and any subsequent earnings from your contributions.\nHowever, in most defined contribution plans, you may have to work several years before you\nare vested in the employer\u2019s matching contributions. (There are exceptions, such as the\nSIMPLE 401(k) and safe harbor 401(k), in which you are immediately vested in all required\nemployer contributions. You also vest immediately in the SIMPLE IRA and the SEP.)\nCurrently, employers have a choice of two different vesting schedules for employer matching\n401(k) contributions, which are shown in Table 2 on page 8. Your employer may use a cliff vesting\nschedule in which employees are 100 percent vested in employer contributions after 3 years of\nservice. Under a graduated vesting schedule, an employee must be at least 20 percent vested\nafter 2 years, 40 percent after 3 years, 60 percent after 4 years, 80 percent after 5 years, and 100\npercent after 6 years. If your automatic enrollment 401(k) plan requires employer contributions,\nyou vest in those contributions after 2 years. Automatic enrollment 401(k) plans with optional\nmatching contributions follow one of the vesting schedules noted above.\nEmployers making other contributions to defned contribution plans, such as a 401(k) plan,\nalso can choose between the graduated and cliff vesting schedules. For those contributions\nmade since 2007, they can choose between the schedules in Table 2. For contributions made\nprior to 2007, they can choose between the schedules provided in Table 3.\nYou may lose some of the employer-provided benefits you have earned if you leave\nyour job before you have worked long enough to be vested. However, once vested, you\nhave the right to receive the vested portion of your benefits even if you leave your job before\nretirement. But even though you have the right to certain benefits, your defined contribution\nplan account value could decrease as a result of investment performance after you leave\nyour job.\nNOTE\nIf you leave your company and return, you may be able to count your earlier period\nof employment towards the years of service needed to vest in the employer-provided\nbenefits. Unless your break in service with the company was 5 years or a time equal to the\nlength of your pre-break employment, whichever is longer, you likely can count that time\nprior to your break. Because these rules are very specific, you should read your plan\ndocument carefully if you are contemplating a short-term break from your employer, and\nthen discuss it with your plan administrator. If you left employment before Janu ary 1,\n1985, different rules apply. For more information, contact the Department of Labor\nelectronically or by calling toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nFor Reserve and National Guard units called to active duty, the Uniformed Services\nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) requires that the period of military duty\nbe counted as covered service with the employer for eligibility, vesting, and benefit\naccrual purposes. Returning service members are treated as if they had been continuously\nemployed regardless of the type of retirement plan the employer has adopted. However, a\nperson who is reemployed is entitled to accrued benefits resulting from employee\ncontributions only to the extent they actually make the contributions to the plan.\n7\nVesting Rules\nGenerally, an employer must count your years of service for vesting credit starting with your\ndate of employment. Two exceptions provide that your employer can start counting your\nyears of service with the frst plan year following (1) your 18th birthday if you were under 18\nyears of age when you started working there, and (2) the date you start contributing to a 401(k)\nplan if you elected not to contribute when you were frst eligible.\nPlans can allow employees the right to employer-provided benefts sooner than indicated in\nthe following tables.\nM V R U ERISA\nINIMUM ESTING EQUIREMENTS NDER\nE C\nMPLOYER ONTRIBUTIONS\n(U T E D Y L E )\nSE ABLE IN FFECT ON ATE OU EFT MPLOYER\nTable 2 below shows the current vesting schedules, as of 2002, for employer matching 401(k)\nplan contributions, and for other employer contributions to a defned contribution plan as of\n2007.\nTABLE 2: Effective Date 1/01/02 - Present \u2014\nfor 401(k) Matching Contributions\nEffective Date 1/01/07 \u2013 Present \u2014\nfor Other Defined Contribution\nEmployer Contributions\nGRADUATED VESTING\nYears of Service Non-forfeitable Percentage\n2 20%\n3 40%\n4 60%\n5 80%\n6 100%\nCliff Vesting\nLess than 3 years of service - 0% Vested\nAt least 3 years of service - 100% Vested\nTable 3 is for employees in a defned beneft plan.

You can request this information from\nyour plan administrator, the person who is in charge of running the plan. Your employer\ncan tell you how to contact your plan administrator.\nI\nNFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE RETIREMENT PLAN\nEach retirement plan must have a formal, written plan document that details how it\noperates and its requirements. As noted previously, there is also a booklet that describes\nthe key plan rules, called the Summary Plan Description (SPD), which should be much\neasier to read and understand. The SPD also should include a summary of any material\nchanges to the plan or to the information required to be in the SPD. You can start with\nthe SPD and then look at the plan document if you still have questions.\nIn addition, plans must provide you with a number of notices. Some of the key notices\nare described in Table 5 on page 12.\nFor example, defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans, generally must provide\nadvance notice to employees when a \u201cblackout period\u201d occurs. A blackout period is when\na participant\u2019s right to direct investments, take loans, or obtain distributions is suspended\nfor a period of at least three consecutive business days. Blackout periods often occur\nwhen plans change recordkeepers or investment options.\nSome plan information, such as the Summary Plan Description, must be provided to\nyou automatically and without charge at the times indicated below. You may request a\nSummary Plan Description at other times, but your employer might charge you a copying\nfee. You must ask the plan if you want other information, such as a copy of the written\nplan document or the plan\u2019s Form 5500 annual financial report, and you may have to pay\na copying fee. See Table 5 on page 12 and Table 6 on page 14. Many employers provide\nbenefit information on their websites.\nThe plan\u2019s annual financial report (Form 5500) is also available. You can find the report\nonline or by contacting the U.S. Department of Labor, EBSA Public Disclosure Facility,\nRoom N-1515, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20210, telephone:\n(202) 693-8673. There is a copying fee if the report is over 100 pages. If your plan\nadministrator does not provide you, as a participant covered under the plan, with a\ncopy of the Summary Plan Description automatically or after you request it, you may\ncontact the Department of Labor electronically or by calling toll free 1-866-444-3272 for\nhelp.\n11\nTABLE 5: K I Y P A M P A\nEY NFORMATION OUR LAN DMINISTRATOR UST ROVIDE UTOMATICALLY\nWhat Description When\nSummary Plan A summary version of the plan Within 90 days of becoming a\nDescription (SPD) document and other important participant in the plan; and\nplan information, in easier-to- An updated copy every 10\nunderstand language. years (5 years if the plan has\nbeen amended).\nAutomatic A description of the automatic Generally, at least 30 days\nenrollment process, the before you are eligible to\nEnrollment Notice\npercentage of salary being participate; and\ndeferred, the default At least 30 days before the\ninvestment used for automatic beginning of each subsequent\ncontributions, your right to plan year.\nopt out of the plan, your right\nto change deferral percentage\nand investments, and how to\nfnd information about the\nplan\u2019s other investments.\nIndividual Benefit A statement providing At least quarterly for\nStatement information about your participant-directed defned\naccount balance and vested contribution plans;\nbenefts.

Federal law provides guidelines, shown in Table 7 below, for when plans\nmust start paying retirement benefts.\n2. Plans can choose to start paying benefts sooner. The plan documents will\nstate when you may begin receiving payments from your plan.\n3. You must fle a claim for benefts for your payments to begin. This takes\nsome time for administrative reasons. (See Chapter 6.)\nTABLE 7: Requirements Under Federal Law for Payment of Retirement Benefits\nUnder Federal law, your plan must allow you to begin receiving benefts*\nthe later of -\nOr - Or -\nReaching age 65 or the age your plan considers to 10 years of Terminating your\nbe normal retirement age (if earlier) service service with the\nemployer\n*For administrative reasons, benefts do not begin immediately after meeting these\nconditions. At a minimum, your plan must provide that you will start receiving benefts\nwithin 60 days after the end of the plan year in which you satisfy the conditions. Also, you\nneed to fle a claim under your plan\u2019s procedures. (See Chapter 6.)\nUnder certain circumstances, your beneft payments may be suspended if you continue\nto work beyond normal retirement age. The plan must notify you of the suspension\nduring the frst calendar month or payroll period in which it withholds payments. This\ninformation also should be included in the Summary Plan Description. A plan must advise\nyou of its procedures to request an advance determination of whether a particular type\nof reemployment would result in a suspension of beneft payments. If you are a retiree\nand are considering taking a job, you may wish to write to your plan administrator and\nask if your benefts would be suspended.\nTable 7 shows the general requirements for when payments begin. Listed below are\nsome permitted variations:\nAlthough defned beneft plans and money purchase plans generally allow you\nto receive benefts only when you reach the plan\u2019s retirement age, some have\nprovisions for early retirement.\n17\n401(k)plans often allow you to receive your account balance when you leave your job.\n401(k) plans may allow for distributions while still employed if you have reached age\n59\u00bd or if you suffer a hardship.\nProft sharing plans may permit you to receive your vested beneft after a specifc\nnumber of years or whenever you leave your job.\nA phased retirement option allows employees at or near retirement age to reduce\ntheir work hours to part time, receive benefts, and continue to earn additional funds.\nESOPs do not have to pay out any benefts until 1 year after the plan year in which\nyou retire, or as many as 6 years if you leave for reasons other than retirement, death,\nor disability.\nW\nARNING\n1. You may owe current income taxes \u2013 and possibly tax penalties \u2014 on your\ndistribution if you take money out before age 59\u00bd, unless you transfer it to an\nIRA or another tax-qualifed retirement plan.\n2. Taking all or a portion of your funds out of your account before retirement age\nwill mean you have less in retirement benefts.\nW ?\nHEN IS THE LATEST YOU MAY BEGIN TO TAKE PAYMENT OF YOUR BENEFITS\nFederal law sets a mandatory date by which you must start receiving your retirement benefts,\neven if you would like to wait longer. This mandatory start date generally is set to begin on\nApril 1 following the calendar year in which you turn 72 or, if later, when you retire. However,\nyour plan may require you to begin receiving distributions even if you have not retired by age\n72.If you reached age 70\u00bd before 2020, you may have a required minimum distribution for 2021\neven though you\u2019re not yet 72.\nH ?\nOW WILL YOUR BENEFITS BE PAID\nIf you are in a defned beneft or money purchase plan, the plan must offer you a beneft\nin the form of a life annuity, which means that you will receive equal, periodic payments, often\nas a monthly beneft, for the rest of your life. Defned beneft and money purchase plans also\nmay offer other payment options, so check with the plan. If you are in a defned contribution\nplan (other than a money purchase plan), the plan may pay your benefts in a single lump sum\npayment as well as offer other options, including payments over a set period of time (such as\n5 or 10 years) or an annuity with monthly lifetime payments.\nIf you are leaving your employer before retirement age, see the next chapter.\nC ?\nAN A BENEFIT CONTINUE FOR YOUR SPOUSE IF YOU DIE FIRST\nIn a defned beneft or money purchase plan, unless you and your spouse choose otherwise,\nthe form of payment will include a survivor\u2019s beneft. This survivor\u2019s beneft, called a qualifed\njoint and survivor annuity (QJSA), will provide payments over your lifetime and your spouse\u2019s\nlifetime. The beneft payment that your surviving spouse receives must be at least half of the\nbeneft payment you received during your joint lives. While the survivor\u2019s beneft is typically\n50 percent, some plans provide for other options, such as 75 percent. Note that your monthly\nbeneft payments will be reduced because the beneft payments will continue for your spouse\u2019s\nlife if you die frst.\n18\nIf you choose not to receive the survivor\u2019s beneft, you will receive benefts for your lifetime\nonly. You must follow specifc rules to waive the survivor beneft. You and your spouse must\nreceive a written explanation of the qualifed joint and survivor annuity. Within certain time\nlimits, you must make a written waiver and your spouse must sign a written consent to the\nalternative payment form without a survivor\u2019s beneft, stating that you both understand that\nbeneft payments will end when you die. A notary or plan representative must witness your\nspouse\u2019s signature.\nIn most 401(k) plans and other defned contribution plans, the plan is written so different\nprotections apply for surviving spouses. In most defned contribution plans, if you die before\nyou receive your benefts, they automatically will go to your surviving spouse. If you wish to\nselect a different benefciary, your spouse must consent by signing a waiver, witnessed by a\nnotary or plan representative.\nIf you were single when you enrolled in the plan and subsequently married, it is important\nthat you notify your employer and/or plan administrator and change your status under the plan.\nIf you do not have a spouse, it is important to name a benefciary.\nIf you or your spouse left employment before January 1, 1985, different rules apply.\nFor more information on these rules, contact the Department of Labor electronically or by\ncalling toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nC\nAN YOU BORROW FROM YOUR\n401(\nK\n)\nPLAN ACCOUNT\n?\n401(k) plans can \u2013 but are not required to \u2013 offer loans to participants. The loans must charge\na reasonable rate of interest and be adequately secured. The plan must include a procedure\nfor applying for the loans and the plan\u2019s policy for granting them. Loan amounts are limited to\nthe lesser of 50 percent of your account balance or $50,000 and must be repaid within 5 years\n(unless the loan is used to purchase a principal residence).\nC AN YOU GET A DISTRIBUTION FROM YOUR PLAN IF YOU ARE NOT YET 65 OR YOUR PLAN \u2019 S\n?\nNORMAL RETIREMENT AGE BUT ARE FACING A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP\nAgain, defned contribution plans can \u2013 but are not required to \u2013 provide distributions in\ncase of hardship. Check your plan booklet to see if your plan does permit them and under\nwhat circumstances.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nFind out when and how you can receive your benefts at retirement.\nFill out the necessary forms to update information with your retirement plan.\nNotify the retirement plan of any change of address or marital status.\nKeep all documents for your records, including Summary Plan Descriptions, company\nmemos, and individual benefit statements.\nFor tax information, look at Internal Revenue Service Publication 575 (Pension\nand Annuity Income).\n19\nC 5: T Y R B W Y\nHAPTER AKING OUR ETIREMENT ENEFIT ITH OU\nIf you leave an employer before you reach retirement age, whether or not you can take\nyour benefts out and/or roll them into another tax-qualifed plan or account will depend\non what type of plan you are in.\nI ,\nF YOU LEAVE BEFORE RETIREMENT CAN YOU TAKE YOUR RETIREMENT BENEFIT WITH\n?\nYOU\nIf you are in a defned beneft plan (other than a cash balance plan), you most likely\nwill have to leave the benefts with the retirement plan until you are eligible to receive\nthem. Therefore, it is very important that you update your personal information with the\nplan administrator regularly and keep current on any changes in your former employer\u2019s\nownership or address.\nIf you are in a cash balance plan, you probably will have the option to transfer at\nleast a portion of your account balance to an individual retirement account or to a new\nemployer\u2019s plan.\nIf you are in a defned contribution plan (such as a 401(k) plan) and you leave your\nemployer before retirement age, in most cases you will be able to transfer your account\nbalance out of your employer\u2019s plan.\nW ?\nHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE FOR TAKING YOUR DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS\nA lump sum \u2013 you can choose to receive your benefts as a single payment from\nyour plan, effectively cashing out your account. You may need to pay income\ntaxes on the amount you receive, and possibly a penalty.\nA rollover to another retirement plan \u2013 you can ask your employer to transfer\nyour account balance directly to your new employer\u2019s plan if it accepts such\ntransfers.\nA rollover to an IRA \u2013 you can ask your employer to transfer your account\nbalance directly to an individual retirement account (IRA).\nIf your account balance is less than $5,000 when you leave the employer,\nthe plan can make an immediate distribution without your consent. If this\ndistribution is more than $1,000, the plan must automatically roll the funds into\nan IRA it selects, unless you decide to receive a lump sum payment or to roll\nit over into an IRA you choose. The plan must frst send you a notice allowing\nyou to make other arrangements, and it must follow rules regarding what type\nof IRA can be used (i.e., it cannot combine the distribution with savings you\nhave deposited directly in an IRA). Rollovers must be made to an entity that is\nqualifed to offer individual retirement plans. Also, the rollover IRA must have\ninvestments designed to preserve principal. The IRA provider may not charge\nmore in fees and expenses for such plans than it would its other individual\nretirement plan customers.\nPlease note: If you choose a lump sum payment and do not transfer the money to\nanother retirement account (employer plan or IRA other than a Roth IRA), you will owe\na tax penalty if you are under age 59\u00bd and do not meet certain exceptions. In addition,\nyou may have less to live on during your retirement. Transferring your retirement plan\naccount balance to another plan or an IRA when you leave your job will protect the tax\nadvantages of your account and preserve the benefts for retirement.\n21\nW ?\nHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LEAVE A JOB AND LATER RETURN\nIf you leave an employer for whom you have worked for several years and later return, you\nmay be able to count those earlier years toward vesting. Generally, a plan must preserve the\nservice credit you have accumulated if you leave your employer and then return within fve\nyears. Service credit refers to the years of service that count towards vesting. Because these\nrules are very specifc, you should read your plan document carefully if you are contemplating\na short-term break from your employer, and then discuss it with your plan administrator. If you\nleft employment prior to January 1, 1985, different rules apply.\nIf you retire and later go back to work for a former employer, you must be allowed to continue\nto accrue additional benefts, subject to a plan limit on the total years of service credited under\nthe plan.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nIf you leave an employer before retirement, fnd out whether you can roll your\nbenefts into a new plan or into an IRA.\nIf you leave your benefits in your former employer\u2019s plan, keep your contact\ninformation up to date with the former employer, and keep track of the employer\u2019s\ncontact information.\nIf you are considering taking your benefts as a lump sum, fnd out what taxes and\npenalties you will owe and plan on how you will replace that income in retirement.\n22\nC 6: F C B\nHAPTER ILING A LAIM FOR ENEFITS\nFederal retirement law requires all plans to have a reasonable written procedure for\nprocessing your benefts claim and appeal if your claim is denied. The Summary Plan\nDescription (SPD) should include your plan\u2019s claims procedures. Usually, you fll out the\nrequired paperwork and submit it to the plan administrator, who then can tell you what\nyour benefts will be and when they will start.\nF C F A\nILING A LAIM AND ILING AN PPEAL\nIf there is a problem or a dispute about whether you qualify for benefts or what\namount you should receive, check your plan\u2019s claims procedure. Federal law outlines the\nfollowing claims procedures requirements:\nOnce you fle your claim, the plan can take up to 90 days to reach a decision,\nor 180 days if it notifes you that it needs an extension.\nIf the plan denies your claim, it must send you a written notice, including specifc\ninformation about why your claim was denied and how to fle an appeal.\nYou have 60 days to request a full and fair review of your denied claim, using\nyour plan\u2019s appeals procedure.\nThe plan can take up to 60 days to review your appeal, as well as an additional\n60 days if it notifes you of the need for an extension. The plan must send a\nwritten notice telling you whether the appeal was granted or denied.\nIf the appeal is denied, the written notice must tell you the reason, describe\nany additional appeal levels, and give you a statement about your rights to seek\njudicial review of the plan\u2019s decision.\nIf the plan denies your appeal and you believe it failed to follow ERISA\u2019s\nrequirements, you may decide to seek legal advice. You also can contact the Department\nof Labor about your rights under ERISA electronically or by calling toll free\n1-866-444-3272.\nFor more information on claims procedures, see the Department of Labor\npublication Filing a Claim for Your Retirement Benefits. To obtain a copy, contact the\nDepartment of Labor electronically or call toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nContact your plan administrator to get the paperwork that you need to fle a\nclai m for retirement benefits.\nContact the Department of Labor (EBSA) electronically or by calling toll free\n1-866-444-3272 if you have questions about your plan or your rights under\nERISA.\n23\nC 7: R P F\nHAPTER ESPONSIBILITIES OF LAN IDUCIARIES\nIn every retirement plan, there are individuals or groups of people who use their\nown judgment or discretion in administering and managing the plan or who have the\npower to or actually control the plan\u2019s assets. These individuals or groups are called plan\nfduciaries. Fiduciary status is based on the functions that the person performs for the\nplan, not just their title.\nD ?\nOES YOUR PLAN HAVE TO IDENTIFY THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR OPERATING THE PLAN\nA plan must name at least one fduciary in the written plan document, or through a\nprocess described in the plan, as having control over the plan\u2019s operations. This fduciary\ncan be identifed by offce or by name. For some plans, it may be an administrative\ncommittee or the company\u2019s board of directors. Usually, a plan\u2019s fduciaries will include\nthe trustee, investment managers, and the plan administrator. The plan administrator is\nusually the best starting point for questions you might have about the plan.\nW ?\nHAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PLAN FIDUCIARIES\nFiduciaries have important responsibilities and are subject to certain standards of\nconduct because they act on behalf of the participants in the plan. These responsibilities\ninclude:\nActing solely in the interest of plan participants and their benefciaries, with\nthe exclusive purpose of providing benefts to them;\nCarrying out their duties with skill, prudence, and diligence;\nFollowing the plan documents (unless inconsistent with ERISA);\nDiversifying plan investments;\nPaying only reasonable expenses of administering the plan and investing its\nassets; and\nAvoiding conficts of interest.\nThe fduciary also is responsible for selecting the investment providers and the\ninvestment options, and for monitoring their performance. Some plans, such as most 401(k)\nor proft sharing plans, can be set up to permit participants to choose the investments\nin their accounts (within certain investment options provided by the plan). If the plan is\nproperly set up to give participants control over their investments, then the fduciary is\nnot liable for losses resulting from the participant\u2019s investment decisions. Department\nof Labor rules provide guidance to make sure participants have suffcient information on\ntheir investment options so they can make informed decisions. This information includes:\nA description of each investment option, including the investment goals, risk,\nand return characteristics;\nInformation about any designated investment managers;\nAn explanation of when and how to request changes in investments, plus any\nrestrictions on when you can change investments;\n25\nA statement of the fees that may be charged to your account when you change\ninvestment options or buy and sell investments;\nThe name, address, and telephone number of the plan fduciary or other person\ndesignated to provide certain additional information on request; and\nA statement that the plan intends to follow the Department of Labor rules and that\nthe fduciaries may be relieved of liability for losses that are the direct and necessary\nresult of a participant\u2019s investment instructions.\nFor an automatic enrollmen t plan, such as an automatic enrollment 401(k) plan, the plan\nfiduciary selects th e investments for em ployees\u2019 automatic contributions if the employees do\nnot provide direction. If the plan is properly set up, using certain default investments that\ngenerally minimize the risk of large losses and provide long-term growth, and providing notice of\nthe plan\u2019s automatic enrollment process, then the fiduciary may be relieved of liability for\nlosses resulting from investing in these default alternatives. The plan also must provide a br oad\nrange of investments for participants to choose from and information on those investments so\nparticipants can make informed decisions. Department of Labor rules provide guidance on the\ndefault investment alternatives that can be used and the notice and information participants\nmust receive.\nW ?\nHAT IF A PLAN FIDUCIARY FAILS TO CARRY OUT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES\nFiduciaries that do not follow the required standards of conduct may be personally lia ble.\nIf the plan loses money because of a breach of their duties, fiduciaries would have to restore\nthose losses, or any profits received through their improper actions. For example, if an emplo yer\ndoes not forward participants\u2019 401(k) contributions to the plan, they would have to pay back the\ncontributions to the plan as well as any lost earnings, and return any profits they improperly\nreceived. Fiduciaries also can be removed from their positions as fiduciaries if they fail to fol low\nthe standards of conduct.\nW ?\nHEN DOES THE EMPLOYER NEED TO DEPOSIT EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE PLAN\nIf you contribute to your retirement plan through deductions from your paycheck, then the\nemployer must follow certain rules to make sure that it deposits the contributions in a timely\nmanner. The law says that the employer must deposit participant contributions as soon as it\nis reasonably possible to separate them from the company\u2019s assets, but no later than the 15th\nbusiness day of the month following the payday. For small plans (those with fewer than 100\nparticipants), salary reduction contributions deposited with the plan no later than the 7th business day\nfollowing withholding by the employer will be considered contributed in compliance with\nthe law. In the Annual Report (Form 5500), the plan administrator must include information on\nwhether deposits of contributions were made on a timely basis. For more information, see\nthe Department of Labor\u2019s Ten Warning Signs That Your 401(k) Contributions Are Being\nMisused for indicators of possible delays in depositing contributions.\n26\nW \u2019\nHAT ARE THE PLAN FIDUCIARIES OBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE FEES AND EXPENSES PAID BY\n? C ?\nTHE PLAN AN THE PLAN CHARGE MY DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN ACCOUNT FOR FEES\nPlan fduciaries have to consider the fees and expenses paid by your plan for its operations.\nERISA\u2019s fduciary standards, discussed above, mean that fduciaries must:\nEstablish a prudent process for selecting investment alternatives and service providers\nto the plan;\nEnsure that fees paid to service providers and other plan expenses are reasonable in\nlight of the level and quality of services provided;\nSelect prudent and adequately diversifed investment alternatives; and\nMonitor investment alternatives and service providers to see that they continue to be\nappropriate choices.\nThe plan may deduct plan administration and investment fees from your defined\ncontribution plan account, either as a direct charge or indirectly as a reduction of your\naccount\u2019s investment returns. Fees for individual services, such as for processing a loan from\nthe plan or a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (see Chapter 9), also may be charged to\nyour account.\nIf you direct the investments in your account, your plan will provide information about\nyour rights and responsibilities under the plan related to directing them. This includes\nplan and investment-related information, including information about fees and expenses,\nthat you need to make informed decisions about the management of your account. The\ninvestment-related information is provided in a format, such as a chart, that allows for a\ncomparison among the plan\u2019s investment options. The plan should provide this\ninformation before you can direct investments for the first time and annually thereafter\nwith information on the fees and expenses actually paid provided at least quarterly.\nFor more information, see the Department of Labor brochure A Look at 401(k) Plan\nFees. To obtain a copy, contact the Department of Labor electronically or call toll free at\n1-866-444-3272.\nA I\nCTION TEM\nIf you have any questions about the management of the plan and its assets, contact\nyour plan administrator.\n27\nC 8: Y B D P T\nHAPTER OUR ENEFIT URING A LAN ERMINATION\nC M\nOR OMPANY ERGER\nAs noted at the beginning of this booklet, employers are not required to offer a\nretirement plan, and they can modify and/or terminate plans.\nW ?\nHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PLAN IS TERMINATED\nFederal law provides some measures to protect employees who participated in\nplans that are terminated, both defined benefit and defined contribution. When a plan\nis terminated, the current employees must become 100 percent vested in their\naccrued benefits. This means you have a right to all the benefits that you have earned\nat the time of plan termination, even benefits in which you were not vested and\nwould have lost if you had left the employer. If there is a partial termination of a\nplan (for example, if your employer closes a particular plant or division that results in\nthe end of employment of a substantial percentage of plan participants), the affected\nemployees must be immediately 100 percent vested to the extent the plan is funded.\nW\nHAT IF YOUR TERMINATED DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY\n?\nTO PAY THE BENEFITS\nThe Federal Government, through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\n(PBGC), insures most private defined benefit plans. For terminated defined benefit\nplans that do not have enough money to pay all of the benefits, the PBGC will\nguarantee the payment of your vested pension benefits up to the limits set by law. For\nfurther information on plan termination guarantees, contact the Pension Benefit\nGuaranty Corporation toll free at 1-800-400-7242, or visit the website.\nW ?\nHAT HAPPENS IF A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN IS TERMINATED\nThe PBGC does not guarantee benefits for defined contribution plans. If you are\nin a defined contribution plan that is in the process of terminating, the plan fiduciaries\nand trustees should maintain the plan until they terminate it and pay out the assets.\nI ?\nS YOUR ACCRUED BENEFIT PROTECTED IF YOUR PLAN MERGES WITH ANOTHER PLAN\nYour plan rules and investment choices likely will change if your company merges\nwith another. Your employer may choose to merge your plan with another plan. If your\nplan is terminated because of the merger, the benefits that you have accrued cannot be\nreduced. You must receive a benefit that is at least equal to what you were entitled to\nbefore the merger. In a defined contribution plan, the value of your account may still\nfluctuate after the merger based on investment performance.\nSpecial rules apply to mergers of multiemployer defined benefit plans, which\ngenerally are under the jurisdiction of the PBGC. Contact the PBGC for further\ninformation.\nW ?\nHAT IF YOUR EMPLOYER GOES BANKRUPT\nGenerally, your retirement assets should not be at risk if your employer declares\nbankruptcy. Federal law requires that retirement plans fund promised benefits\nadequately and keep plan assets separate from the employer\u2019s business assets. The\nfunds must be held in trust or invested in an insurance contract. The employers\u2019\n29\ncreditors cannot make a claim on retirement plan funds. However, you should confirm that\nany contributions your employer deducts from your paycheck are forwarded to the plan\u2019s\ntrust or insurance contract in a timely manner.\nSignificant business events such as bankruptcies, mergers, and acquisitions can result\nin employers abandoning their individual account plans (e.g., 401(k) plans), leaving no\nplan fiduciary to manage it. In this situation, participants often have difficulty in accessing\ntheir earned benefits and have no one to contact with questions. Custodians such as banks,\ninsurers, and mutual fund companies are left holding the assets of these plans but do not\nhave the authority to terminate the plans and distribute the assets. In response, the\nDepartment of Labor issued rules to create a voluntary process for the custodian to wind\nup the plan\u2019s business so that benefit distributions can be made and the plan\nterminated. Information about this program can be found on the Department of Labor\u2019s\nwebsite.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nIf your former employer has gone out of business, arrangements should have been\nmade so a plan official remains responsible for the payment of benefits and other\nplan business. If you are entitled to benefits and are unable to contact the plan\nadministrator, contact EBSA electronically or by calling toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nKeep a file with information on your plan and company. If the company no longer\nexists under its former name, you might find some information on the Internet by\nentering the former name in a search engine. If your plan is abandoned, use the\nsearch function on the EBSA website to find out if the plan\u2019s custodian is terminating\nthe plan and the custodian\u2019s co ntact information.\nIf your plan merges, make sure you read the communications about changes in your\nplan, including changes in benefits and investment choices.\nIf your retirement benefit remains with a former employer, keep current on any\nchanges your former employer makes, including changes of address, mergers, or\nemployer name.\nIf you move, give the plan your new contact information.\n30\nC 9: P C A Y B\nHAPTER OTENTIAL LAIMS GAINST OUR ENEFIT\n(D )\nIVORCE\nYour retirement plan generally is safe from claims by other people. Creditors to\nwhom you owe money cannot make a claim against your funds in a retirement plan. For\nexample, if you leave your employer and transfer your 401(k) account into an individual\nretirement account (IRA), creditors generally cannot get access to those IRA funds even\nif you declare bankruptcy.\nFederal law does make an exception for family support and the division of property\nat divorce. For many workers, retirement savings is one of their most signifcant assets.\nFor this reason, whether and how to divide a participant\u2019s interest in a retirement plan\nare often important considerations in separation, divorce, and other domestic relations\nproceedings. While state domestic relations law generally governs the division of marital\nproperty, any assignments of retirement benefts also must comply with Federal law,\nspecifcally ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.\nA state court can award part or all of a participant\u2019s retirement beneft to the spouse,\nformer spouse, child, or other dependent. The recipient named in the order is called\nthe alternate payee. The court issues a specifc order, called a domestic relations order,\nwhich can be in the form of a state court judgment, decree or order, or court approval\nof a property settlement agreement. The order must relate to child support, alimony, or\nmarital property rights, and must be made under state domestic relations law.\nThe plan administrator determines if the order is a qualifed domestic relations order\n(QDRO) under the plan\u2019s procedures and then notifes the participant and the alternate\npayee.\nTo be a QDRO, the order must contain the following information:\nThe participant\u2019s name and last known mailing address;\nThe name and last known mailing address of each alternate payee;\nThe name of the plan;\nThe amount, percentage, or method of determining the amount or percentage of\nthe beneft to be paid to the alternate payee, and\nThe number of payments or time period to which the order applies.\nThe specific content of the rest of the order will depend on the type of retirement\nplan, the nature of the participant\u2019s benefits, the purpose for issuing the order, and the\nintent of the parties drafting the order . A QDRO must provide for a type or form of bene fit\nthat the plan already allows. It cannot require the plan to provide increased benefits. In\ngeneral, a QDRO may assign survivor benefits to a former spouse.

The contributions go into a 401(k) account, with the\nemployee often choosing the investments based on options provided under the p lan.\nIn some plans, the employer also contributes, matching the employee\u2019s contributions up\nto a certain percentage. SIMPLE and safe harbor 401(k) plans have additional employer\ncontribution and vesting requirements.\nAutomatic Enrollment \u2013 Employers can automatically enroll employees in a plan, suc h as a\n401(k) or SIMPLE IRA plan, and place contributions deducted from employees\u2019 paycheck s into\ncertain predetermined investments, unless the employees decide otherwise. Participants can\nopt out of participation and have periodic opportunities to change their investments\n(or in a SIMPLE IRA, the financial institution where the contributions are invested).\nBenefit Accrual \u2013 The amount of benefits accumulated under the plan.\nCash Balance Plan \u2013 A type of defined benefit plan that includes some elements that are\nsimilar to a defined contribution plan because the benefit amount is computed based on\na formula using contribution and earning credits, and each participant has a hypothetical\naccount. Cash balance plans are more likely than traditional defined benefit plans to\nmake lump sum distributions. (For more information, see Cash Balance Pension Pl ans:\nQuestions and Answers.)\nDefined Benefit Pl an \u2013 This type of plan, also known as the traditional pension plan,\npromises the participant a specified monthly benefit at retirement. The benefit often is\nbased on factors such a s your salary, your age, and the number of years you worked for the\nemployer.\nDefined Contribution Plan \u2013 In a defined contribution plan, the employee and/or the\nemployer contribute to the employee\u2019s individual plan account. The employee often decides\nhow their account is invested. The value of the account will change based on the value and\nperformance of the investments. The amount in the account at distribution includes the\ncontributions and investment gains or losses, minus any investment and administrative fees.\nThe contributions and earnings are not taxed until distribution.\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) \u2013 A Federal law that sets\ns tandards of protection for individuals in most voluntarily established, private-sector\nretirement plans. ERISA:\nRequires plans to provide plan information to participants, including important facts\nabout plan features and funding;\nSets minimum standards for participation, vesting, benefit accrual, and funding;\nProvides fiduciary responsibilities for those who manage and control plan assets;\nRequires plans to establish a claims and appeals process for participants to\nget benefits from their plans;\n35\nGives participants the right to sue for benefts and breaches of fduciary duty; and,\nIf a defned beneft plan is terminated, guarantees payment of certain benefts through\na Federally chartered corporation, known as the Pension Beneft Guaranty Corporation\n(PBGC).\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) \u2013 A type of defned contribution plan that is invested\nprimarily in employer stock.\nIndividual Beneft Statement \u2013 An individual beneft statement provides information about\na participant\u2019s retirement benefts, such as the total plan benefts earned and vested benefts,\non a periodic basis. Additional information may be included depending upon the type of plan,\nsuch as how a participant\u2019s 401(k) plan account is invested and the value of those investments.\nIndividual Retirement Account (IRA) \u2013 An individual account set up with a fnancial institution,\nsuch as a bank or a mutual fund company. Under Federal law, individuals may set aside personal\nsavings up to a certain amount, and the investments grow, tax deferred. In addition, defned\ncontribution plan participants can transfer money from an employer retirement plan to an IRA\nwhen leaving an employer. IRAs can be part of an employer plan.\nMoney Purchase Plan \u2013 A money purchase plan requires set annual contributions from the\nemployer to individual accounts and is subject to other rules.\nMultiemployer Plan \u2013 A retirement plan sponsored by several employers under collective\nbargaining agreements that meets certain other requirements. A participant who changes jobs\nfrom one sponsoring employer to another stays in the same plan.\nPlan Administrator \u2013 The person identifed in the plan document as having responsibility for\nrunning the plan. It could be the employer, a committee of employees, a company executive,\nor someone hired for that purpose.\nPlan Document \u2013 A written instrument under which the plan is established and operated.\nPlan Fiduciary \u2013 Anyone who exercises discretionary authority or discretionary control over\nmanagement or administration of the plan, exercises any authority or control over management\nor disposition of plan assets, or gives investment advice about plan assets for a fee or other\ncompensation.\nPlan Trustee \u2013 Someone who has the exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control\nthe assets of the plan. The trustee can be subject to the direction of a named fduciary and the\nnamed fduciary can appoint one or more investment managers for the plan\u2019s assets.\nPlan Year \u2013 A 12-month period designated by a retirement plan for calculating vesting and\ndistribution, among other things. The plan year can be the calendar year or an alternative\nperiod, e.g., July 1 to June 30.\n36\nProft Sharing Plan \u2013 A proft sharing plan allows the employer each year to determine how\nmuch to contribute to the plan (out of profts or otherwise) in cash or employer stock. The plan\ncontains a formula for allocating the annual contribution among participants.\nRollover \u2013 A rollover occurs when a participant leaves an employer and directs the defned\ncontribution plan to transfer the money in their account to a new plan or individual retirement\naccount. This preserves the benefts and does not trigger any tax consequences if done in a\ntimely manner.\nSafe Harbor 401(k) \u2013 A safe harbor 401(k) is similar to a traditional 401(k) plan, but the\nemployer is required to make contributions for each employee. The employer contributions\nin safe harbor 401(k) plans are immediately 100 percent vested. The safe harbor 401(k) eases\nadministrative burdens on employers by eliminating some of the complex tax rules ordinarily\napplied to traditional 401(k) plans.\nSavings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers (SIMPLE) \u2013 A plan in\nwhich a small business with 100 or fewer employees can offer retirement benefts through\nemployee salary reductions and matching contributions (similar to a 401(k) plan). It can be\neither a SIMPLE IRA or a SIMPLE 401(k). SIMPLE IRA plans impose few administrative burdens\non employers because employees own the IRAs, and the bank or fnancial institution receiving\nthe funds does most of the paperwork.

There are two major types of plans, defned beneft\nand defned contribution, which are described here and outlined in Table 1 on page 4.\nKeep in mind that your employer may have more than one type of plan, and may have\ndifferent participation requirements for each.\nA defned beneft plan, funded by the employer, promises you a specifc monthly\nbeneft at retirement. The plan may state this promised beneft as an exact dollar amount,\nsuch as $100 per month at retirement. Or, more often, it may calculate your beneft through\na formula that includes factors such as your salary, your age, and the number of years you\nworked at the company. For example, your pension beneft might be equal to 1 percent\nof your average salary for the last 5 years of employment times your total years of service.\nA defned contribution plan, on the other hand, does not promise you a specifc\nbeneft at retirement. Instead, you and/or your employer contribute money to your\nindividual account in the plan. In many cases, you are responsible for choosing how these\ncontributions are invested, and deciding how much to contribute from your paycheck\nthrough pretax deductions. Your employer may add to your account, in some cases by\nmatching a certain percentage of your contributions. The value of your account depends\non how much is contributed and how well the investments perform. At retirement, you\nreceive the balance in your account, refecting the contributions, investment gains or\nlosses, and any fees charged against your account. The 401(k) plan is a popular type of\ndefned contribution plan. There are four types of 401(k) plans: traditional 401(k), safe\nharbor 401(k), SIMPLE 401(k), and automatic enrollment 401(k) plans. The SIMPLE IRA\nplan, SEP, employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), and proft sharing plan are other\nexamples of defned contribution plans. (See explanations of the various types of plans\nin the Glossary at the end.)\nNOTE\n1. Employers can choose whether to offer a retirement plan to employees;\nFederal law does not require employers to offer or to continue to offer a\nplan.\n2. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees payment\nof certain retirement benefits for participants in most private defined\nbenefit plans if the plan is terminated without enough money to pay all\nof the promised benefits. The government does not guarantee benefit\npayments for defined contribution plans. For more information, see the\nPBGC\u2019s website.\n3. Some hybrid plans \u2013 such as cash balance plans \u2013 contain features of both\ntypes of plans described above. See the Glossary for information on this\ntype of plan.\nA I\nCTION TEM\nAsk your plan administrator, human resources offce or employer for information\non what type of plan or plans you have at work. You can ask for a copy of the\nSummary Plan Description (the retirement plan booklet that you should receive\nwhen you enroll in the plan) and review the information about the plan.\n3\nT 1: C D B D\nABLE HARACTERISTICS OF EFINED ENEFIT AND EFINED\nC P\nONTRIBUTION LANS\nDefined Defined\nBenefit Plan Contribution Plan\nEmployer Employer funded.

Plan rules can vary\nas long as they meet the requirements under Federal law. You need to check with your plan\nor review the plan booklet (called the Summary Plan Description) to learn your plan\u2019s rules\nand requirements. Your plan may require you to work for the company for a period of time\nbefore you can participate in the plan. In addition, there typically is a time frame to begin to\naccumulate benefts and earn the right to them (sometimes referred to as \u201cvesting\u201d).\nW \u2019 ?\nHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN YOUR EMPLOYER S RETIREMENT PLAN\nFind out if you are within the group of employees covered by your employer\u2019s retirement\nplan. Federal law allows employers to include certain groups of employees and exclude\nothers from a retirement plan. For example, your employer may sponsor one plan for salaried\nemployees and another for union employees. Part-time employees may be eligible if they work\nat least 1,000 hours per year, which is about 20 hours per week. So if you work part time, fnd\nout if you are covered.\nW ?\nHEN CAN YOUR PARTICIPATION BEGIN\nOnce you know you are covered, you need to fnd out when you can begin to participate\nin the plan. You can fnd this information in your plan\u2019s Summary Plan Description. Federal\nlaw sets minimum requirements, but a plan may be more generous. Generally, a plan may\nrequire an employee to be at least 21 years old and to have a year of service with the company\nbefore the employee can participate in a plan. However, plans may allow employees to begin\nparticipation before reaching age 21 or completing one year of service. For administrative\nreasons, your participation may be delayed up to 6 months after you meet these age and service\ncriteria or until the start of the next plan year, whichever is sooner. The plan year is the calendar\nyear, or an alternative 12-month period, that a retirement plan uses for plan administration.\nIt is important that you learn the rules for your employer\u2019s plan.\nEmployers can require additional years of service in some circumstances. For example,\nif your plan allows you to vest (discussed in detail later in this chapter) immediately upon\nparticipating in the plan, it may require that you work for the company for two years before\nyou can participate in the plan.\nFederal law also imposes other participation rules for certain circumstances. For example,\nif you were an older worker when you were hired, you cannot be excluded from participating\nin the plan just because you are close to retirement age.\nSome 401(k) plans and SIMPLE IRA plans enroll employees automatically. This means that\nyou will automatically become a participant in the plan unless you choose to opt out. The\nplan will deduct a set contribution level from your paycheck and put it into a predetermined\ninvestment. If your employer has an automatic enrollment plan, you should receive a\nnotice describing the automatic contribution process, when your participation begins, your\nopportunity to opt out of the plan or change your contribution level and where your automatic\ncontributions are invested. If you are in a 401(k), the notice will also describe your right to\nchange investments, or if you are in a SIMPLE IRA plan, your right to change the fnancial\ninstitution where your contributions are invested.\n5\nW ?\nHEN DO YOU BEGIN TO ACCUMULATE BENEFITS\nOnce you begin to participate in a retirement plan, you need to understand how you accrue\nbenefts. Your accrued beneft is the amount of retirement benefts that you have accumulated\nor that have been allocated to you under the plan at any particular point in time.\nDefined benefit plans often count your years of service in order to determine whether you\nhave earned a benefit and to calculate how much you will receive in benefits at retirement .\nEmployees in the plan who work part time, but who work 1,000 hours or more each year, must be\ncredited with a portion of the benefit in proportion to what they would have earned if they were\nemployed full time. In a defined contribution plan, your benefit accrual is the amount of\ncontributions and earnings that have accumulated in your 401(k) or other retirement plan\naccount, minus any fees charged to your account by your plan.\nSpecial rules for when you begin to accumulate benefits may apply to certain types of\nretirement plans. For example, in a Simplifed Employee Pension (SEP) Plan, all participants\nwho earn at least $650 a year from their employers are entitled to receive a contribution.\nC\nAN A PLAN REDUCE PROMISED BENEFITS\n?\nDefined benefit plans may change the rate at which you earn future benefits but cannot\nreduce the amount of benefits you have already accumulated. For example, a plan that accrues\nbenefits at the rate of $5 a month for years of service through 2021 may be amended to\nprovide that for years of service beginning in 2022, benefits will be credited at the rate of $4 per\nmonth. Plans that make a significant reduction in the rate at which benefits accumulate must\nprovide you with written notice generally at least 45 days before the change goes into effect.\nIn most situations, if a company terminates a defined benefit plan that does not h ave\nenough funding to pay all of the promised benefits, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\n(PBGC) will pay plan participants and beneficiaries some retirement benefits, but possibly l ess\nthan the promised benefits. (For more information, see the PBGC\u2019s website.)\nIn a defined contribution plan, the employer can change the amount of emplo yer\ncontributions in the future. The employer may also stop contributing for a few years or\nindefinitely depending on the plan terms.\nAn employer can terminate a defined benefit or a defined contribution plan, but cannot\nreduce the benefit you have already accrued.\nH ?\nOW SOON DO YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO YOUR ACCUMULATED BENEFITS\nYou immediately vest in your own contributions and the earnings on them. This means you\nhave earned the right to these amounts without the risk of forfeiting them. But note \u2013 there\nare restrictions on actually taking them out of the plan. See the discussion on the rules for\ndistributions later in this publication.\nHowever, you do not necessarily have an immediate right to any contributions made by\nyour employer. Federal law provides a maximum number of years a company may require\nemployees to work to earn the vested right to all or some of these benefits. ( See tables on\npages 8-9 showing the vesting rules.)\nIn a defined benefit plan, an employer can require that employees have 5 years of service in\norder to become 100 percent vested in the employer-funded benefits (called cliff vestin g).\nEmployers also can choose a graduated vesting schedule, which requires an employee to work\n7 years in order to be 100 percent vested, but provides at least 20 percent vesting after 3 years, 40\npercent after 4 years, 60 percent after 5 years, and 80 percent after 6 years of service. The\npermitted vesting schedules for current defined benefit plans are shown in Table 3 on page 9.\nPlans may provide a different schedule as long as it is more generous than these vesting\n6\nschedules. (Unlike most defined benefit plans, in a cash balance plan, employees vest in\nemployer contributions after 3 years.)\nIn a defined contribution plan such as a 401(k) plan, you are always 100 percent vested\nin your own contributions and any subsequent earnings from your contributions.\nHowever, in most defined contribution plans, you may have to work several years before you\nare vested in the employer\u2019s matching contributions. (There are exceptions, such as the\nSIMPLE 401(k) and safe harbor 401(k), in which you are immediately vested in all required\nemployer contributions. You also vest immediately in the SIMPLE IRA and the SEP.)\nCurrently, employers have a choice of two different vesting schedules for employer matching\n401(k) contributions, which are shown in Table 2 on page 8. Your employer may use a cliff vesting\nschedule in which employees are 100 percent vested in employer contributions after 3 years of\nservice. Under a graduated vesting schedule, an employee must be at least 20 percent vested\nafter 2 years, 40 percent after 3 years, 60 percent after 4 years, 80 percent after 5 years, and 100\npercent after 6 years. If your automatic enrollment 401(k) plan requires employer contributions,\nyou vest in those contributions after 2 years. Automatic enrollment 401(k) plans with optional\nmatching contributions follow one of the vesting schedules noted above.\nEmployers making other contributions to defned contribution plans, such as a 401(k) plan,\nalso can choose between the graduated and cliff vesting schedules. For those contributions\nmade since 2007, they can choose between the schedules in Table 2. For contributions made\nprior to 2007, they can choose between the schedules provided in Table 3.\nYou may lose some of the employer-provided benefits you have earned if you leave\nyour job before you have worked long enough to be vested. However, once vested, you\nhave the right to receive the vested portion of your benefits even if you leave your job before\nretirement. But even though you have the right to certain benefits, your defined contribution\nplan account value could decrease as a result of investment performance after you leave\nyour job.\nNOTE\nIf you leave your company and return, you may be able to count your earlier period\nof employment towards the years of service needed to vest in the employer-provided\nbenefits. Unless your break in service with the company was 5 years or a time equal to the\nlength of your pre-break employment, whichever is longer, you likely can count that time\nprior to your break. Because these rules are very specific, you should read your plan\ndocument carefully if you are contemplating a short-term break from your employer, and\nthen discuss it with your plan administrator. If you left employment before Janu ary 1,\n1985, different rules apply. For more information, contact the Department of Labor\nelectronically or by calling toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nFor Reserve and National Guard units called to active duty, the Uniformed Services\nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) requires that the period of military duty\nbe counted as covered service with the employer for eligibility, vesting, and benefit\naccrual purposes. Returning service members are treated as if they had been continuously\nemployed regardless of the type of retirement plan the employer has adopted. However, a\nperson who is reemployed is entitled to accrued benefits resulting from employee\ncontributions only to the extent they actually make the contributions to the plan.\n7\nVesting Rules\nGenerally, an employer must count your years of service for vesting credit starting with your\ndate of employment. Two exceptions provide that your employer can start counting your\nyears of service with the frst plan year following (1) your 18th birthday if you were under 18\nyears of age when you started working there, and (2) the date you start contributing to a 401(k)\nplan if you elected not to contribute when you were frst eligible.\nPlans can allow employees the right to employer-provided benefts sooner than indicated in\nthe following tables.\nM V R U ERISA\nINIMUM ESTING EQUIREMENTS NDER\nE C\nMPLOYER ONTRIBUTIONS\n(U T E D Y L E )\nSE ABLE IN FFECT ON ATE OU EFT MPLOYER\nTable 2 below shows the current vesting schedules, as of 2002, for employer matching 401(k)\nplan contributions, and for other employer contributions to a defned contribution plan as of\n2007.\nTABLE 2: Effective Date 1/01/02 - Present \u2014\nfor 401(k) Matching Contributions\nEffective Date 1/01/07 \u2013 Present \u2014\nfor Other Defined Contribution\nEmployer Contributions\nGRADUATED VESTING\nYears of Service Non-forfeitable Percentage\n2 20%\n3 40%\n4 60%\n5 80%\n6 100%\nCliff Vesting\nLess than 3 years of service - 0% Vested\nAt least 3 years of service - 100% Vested\nTable 3 is for employees in a defned beneft plan.

You can request this information from\nyour plan administrator, the person who is in charge of running the plan. Your employer\ncan tell you how to contact your plan administrator.\nI\nNFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE RETIREMENT PLAN\nEach retirement plan must have a formal, written plan document that details how it\noperates and its requirements. As noted previously, there is also a booklet that describes\nthe key plan rules, called the Summary Plan Description (SPD), which should be much\neasier to read and understand. The SPD also should include a summary of any material\nchanges to the plan or to the information required to be in the SPD. You can start with\nthe SPD and then look at the plan document if you still have questions.\nIn addition, plans must provide you with a number of notices. Some of the key notices\nare described in Table 5 on page 12.\nFor example, defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans, generally must provide\nadvance notice to employees when a \u201cblackout period\u201d occurs. A blackout period is when\na participant\u2019s right to direct investments, take loans, or obtain distributions is suspended\nfor a period of at least three consecutive business days. Blackout periods often occur\nwhen plans change recordkeepers or investment options.\nSome plan information, such as the Summary Plan Description, must be provided to\nyou automatically and without charge at the times indicated below. You may request a\nSummary Plan Description at other times, but your employer might charge you a copying\nfee. You must ask the plan if you want other information, such as a copy of the written\nplan document or the plan\u2019s Form 5500 annual financial report, and you may have to pay\na copying fee. See Table 5 on page 12 and Table 6 on page 14. Many employers provide\nbenefit information on their websites.\nThe plan\u2019s annual financial report (Form 5500) is also available. You can find the report\nonline or by contacting the U.S. Department of Labor, EBSA Public Disclosure Facility,\nRoom N-1515, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20210, telephone:\n(202) 693-8673. There is a copying fee if the report is over 100 pages. If your plan\nadministrator does not provide you, as a participant covered under the plan, with a\ncopy of the Summary Plan Description automatically or after you request it, you may\ncontact the Department of Labor electronically or by calling toll free 1-866-444-3272 for\nhelp.\n11\nTABLE 5: K I Y P A M P A\nEY NFORMATION OUR LAN DMINISTRATOR UST ROVIDE UTOMATICALLY\nWhat Description When\nSummary Plan A summary version of the plan Within 90 days of becoming a\nDescription (SPD) document and other important participant in the plan; and\nplan information, in easier-to- An updated copy every 10\nunderstand language. years (5 years if the plan has\nbeen amended).\nAutomatic A description of the automatic Generally, at least 30 days\nenrollment process, the before you are eligible to\nEnrollment Notice\npercentage of salary being participate; and\ndeferred, the default At least 30 days before the\ninvestment used for automatic beginning of each subsequent\ncontributions, your right to plan year.\nopt out of the plan, your right\nto change deferral percentage\nand investments, and how to\nfnd information about the\nplan\u2019s other investments.\nIndividual Benefit A statement providing At least quarterly for\nStatement information about your participant-directed defned\naccount balance and vested contribution plans;\nbenefts.

You will also receive an annual notice of the plan\u2019s funding status.\nDefned contribution plans, including 401(k) plans, also must send participants individual\nbeneft statements either quarterly, if participants direct the investments of their accounts,\nor annually, if they do not. When you receive a statement, check it to make sure all of the\ninformation is accurate. This information may include:\nSalary level\nAmounts that you and your employer have contributed\nYears of service with the employer\nHome address\nSocial Security Number\nBenefciary designation\nMarital status\nThe performance of your investments\nFees paid by the plan and/or charged to participants.

Federal law provides guidelines, shown in Table 7 below, for when plans\nmust start paying retirement benefts.\n2. Plans can choose to start paying benefts sooner. The plan documents will\nstate when you may begin receiving payments from your plan.\n3. You must fle a claim for benefts for your payments to begin. This takes\nsome time for administrative reasons. (See Chapter 6.)\nTABLE 7: Requirements Under Federal Law for Payment of Retirement Benefits\nUnder Federal law, your plan must allow you to begin receiving benefts*\nthe later of -\nOr - Or -\nReaching age 65 or the age your plan considers to 10 years of Terminating your\nbe normal retirement age (if earlier) service service with the\nemployer\n*For administrative reasons, benefts do not begin immediately after meeting these\nconditions. At a minimum, your plan must provide that you will start receiving benefts\nwithin 60 days after the end of the plan year in which you satisfy the conditions. Also, you\nneed to fle a claim under your plan\u2019s procedures. (See Chapter 6.)\nUnder certain circumstances, your beneft payments may be suspended if you continue\nto work beyond normal retirement age. The plan must notify you of the suspension\nduring the frst calendar month or payroll period in which it withholds payments. This\ninformation also should be included in the Summary Plan Description. A plan must advise\nyou of its procedures to request an advance determination of whether a particular type\nof reemployment would result in a suspension of beneft payments. If you are a retiree\nand are considering taking a job, you may wish to write to your plan administrator and\nask if your benefts would be suspended.\nTable 7 shows the general requirements for when payments begin. Listed below are\nsome permitted variations:\nAlthough defned beneft plans and money purchase plans generally allow you\nto receive benefts only when you reach the plan\u2019s retirement age, some have\nprovisions for early retirement.\n17\n401(k)plans often allow you to receive your account balance when you leave your job.\n401(k) plans may allow for distributions while still employed if you have reached age\n59\u00bd or if you suffer a hardship.\nProft sharing plans may permit you to receive your vested beneft after a specifc\nnumber of years or whenever you leave your job.\nA phased retirement option allows employees at or near retirement age to reduce\ntheir work hours to part time, receive benefts, and continue to earn additional funds.\nESOPs do not have to pay out any benefts until 1 year after the plan year in which\nyou retire, or as many as 6 years if you leave for reasons other than retirement, death,\nor disability.\nW\nARNING\n1. You may owe current income taxes \u2013 and possibly tax penalties \u2014 on your\ndistribution if you take money out before age 59\u00bd, unless you transfer it to an\nIRA or another tax-qualifed retirement plan.\n2. Taking all or a portion of your funds out of your account before retirement age\nwill mean you have less in retirement benefts.\nW ?\nHEN IS THE LATEST YOU MAY BEGIN TO TAKE PAYMENT OF YOUR BENEFITS\nFederal law sets a mandatory date by which you must start receiving your retirement benefts,\neven if you would like to wait longer. This mandatory start date generally is set to begin on\nApril 1 following the calendar year in which you turn 72 or, if later, when you retire. However,\nyour plan may require you to begin receiving distributions even if you have not retired by age\n72.If you reached age 70\u00bd before 2020, you may have a required minimum distribution for 2021\neven though you\u2019re not yet 72.\nH ?\nOW WILL YOUR BENEFITS BE PAID\nIf you are in a defned beneft or money purchase plan, the plan must offer you a beneft\nin the form of a life annuity, which means that you will receive equal, periodic payments, often\nas a monthly beneft, for the rest of your life. Defned beneft and money purchase plans also\nmay offer other payment options, so check with the plan. If you are in a defned contribution\nplan (other than a money purchase plan), the plan may pay your benefts in a single lump sum\npayment as well as offer other options, including payments over a set period of time (such as\n5 or 10 years) or an annuity with monthly lifetime payments.\nIf you are leaving your employer before retirement age, see the next chapter.\nC ?\nAN A BENEFIT CONTINUE FOR YOUR SPOUSE IF YOU DIE FIRST\nIn a defned beneft or money purchase plan, unless you and your spouse choose otherwise,\nthe form of payment will include a survivor\u2019s beneft. This survivor\u2019s beneft, called a qualifed\njoint and survivor annuity (QJSA), will provide payments over your lifetime and your spouse\u2019s\nlifetime. The beneft payment that your surviving spouse receives must be at least half of the\nbeneft payment you received during your joint lives. While the survivor\u2019s beneft is typically\n50 percent, some plans provide for other options, such as 75 percent. Note that your monthly\nbeneft payments will be reduced because the beneft payments will continue for your spouse\u2019s\nlife if you die frst.\n18\nIf you choose not to receive the survivor\u2019s beneft, you will receive benefts for your lifetime\nonly. You must follow specifc rules to waive the survivor beneft. You and your spouse must\nreceive a written explanation of the qualifed joint and survivor annuity. Within certain time\nlimits, you must make a written waiver and your spouse must sign a written consent to the\nalternative payment form without a survivor\u2019s beneft, stating that you both understand that\nbeneft payments will end when you die. A notary or plan representative must witness your\nspouse\u2019s signature.\nIn most 401(k) plans and other defned contribution plans, the plan is written so different\nprotections apply for surviving spouses. In most defned contribution plans, if you die before\nyou receive your benefts, they automatically will go to your surviving spouse. If you wish to\nselect a different benefciary, your spouse must consent by signing a waiver, witnessed by a\nnotary or plan representative.\nIf you were single when you enrolled in the plan and subsequently married, it is important\nthat you notify your employer and/or plan administrator and change your status under the plan.\nIf you do not have a spouse, it is important to name a benefciary.\nIf you or your spouse left employment before January 1, 1985, different rules apply.\nFor more information on these rules, contact the Department of Labor electronically or by\ncalling toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nC\nAN YOU BORROW FROM YOUR\n401(\nK\n)\nPLAN ACCOUNT\n?\n401(k) plans can \u2013 but are not required to \u2013 offer loans to participants. The loans must charge\na reasonable rate of interest and be adequately secured. The plan must include a procedure\nfor applying for the loans and the plan\u2019s policy for granting them. Loan amounts are limited to\nthe lesser of 50 percent of your account balance or $50,000 and must be repaid within 5 years\n(unless the loan is used to purchase a principal residence).\nC AN YOU GET A DISTRIBUTION FROM YOUR PLAN IF YOU ARE NOT YET 65 OR YOUR PLAN \u2019 S\n?\nNORMAL RETIREMENT AGE BUT ARE FACING A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP\nAgain, defned contribution plans can \u2013 but are not required to \u2013 provide distributions in\ncase of hardship. Check your plan booklet to see if your plan does permit them and under\nwhat circumstances.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nFind out when and how you can receive your benefts at retirement.\nFill out the necessary forms to update information with your retirement plan.\nNotify the retirement plan of any change of address or marital status.\nKeep all documents for your records, including Summary Plan Descriptions, company\nmemos, and individual benefit statements.\nFor tax information, look at Internal Revenue Service Publication 575 (Pension\nand Annuity Income).\n19\nC 5: T Y R B W Y\nHAPTER AKING OUR ETIREMENT ENEFIT ITH OU\nIf you leave an employer before you reach retirement age, whether or not you can take\nyour benefts out and/or roll them into another tax-qualifed plan or account will depend\non what type of plan you are in.\nI ,\nF YOU LEAVE BEFORE RETIREMENT CAN YOU TAKE YOUR RETIREMENT BENEFIT WITH\n?\nYOU\nIf you are in a defned beneft plan (other than a cash balance plan), you most likely\nwill have to leave the benefts with the retirement plan until you are eligible to receive\nthem. Therefore, it is very important that you update your personal information with the\nplan administrator regularly and keep current on any changes in your former employer\u2019s\nownership or address.\nIf you are in a cash balance plan, you probably will have the option to transfer at\nleast a portion of your account balance to an individual retirement account or to a new\nemployer\u2019s plan.\nIf you are in a defned contribution plan (such as a 401(k) plan) and you leave your\nemployer before retirement age, in most cases you will be able to transfer your account\nbalance out of your employer\u2019s plan.\nW ?\nHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE FOR TAKING YOUR DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS\nA lump sum \u2013 you can choose to receive your benefts as a single payment from\nyour plan, effectively cashing out your account. You may need to pay income\ntaxes on the amount you receive, and possibly a penalty.\nA rollover to another retirement plan \u2013 you can ask your employer to transfer\nyour account balance directly to your new employer\u2019s plan if it accepts such\ntransfers.\nA rollover to an IRA \u2013 you can ask your employer to transfer your account\nbalance directly to an individual retirement account (IRA).\nIf your account balance is less than $5,000 when you leave the employer,\nthe plan can make an immediate distribution without your consent. If this\ndistribution is more than $1,000, the plan must automatically roll the funds into\nan IRA it selects, unless you decide to receive a lump sum payment or to roll\nit over into an IRA you choose. The plan must frst send you a notice allowing\nyou to make other arrangements, and it must follow rules regarding what type\nof IRA can be used (i.e., it cannot combine the distribution with savings you\nhave deposited directly in an IRA). Rollovers must be made to an entity that is\nqualifed to offer individual retirement plans. Also, the rollover IRA must have\ninvestments designed to preserve principal. The IRA provider may not charge\nmore in fees and expenses for such plans than it would its other individual\nretirement plan customers.\nPlease note: If you choose a lump sum payment and do not transfer the money to\nanother retirement account (employer plan or IRA other than a Roth IRA), you will owe\na tax penalty if you are under age 59\u00bd and do not meet certain exceptions. In addition,\nyou may have less to live on during your retirement. Transferring your retirement plan\naccount balance to another plan or an IRA when you leave your job will protect the tax\nadvantages of your account and preserve the benefts for retirement.\n21\nW ?\nHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LEAVE A JOB AND LATER RETURN\nIf you leave an employer for whom you have worked for several years and later return, you\nmay be able to count those earlier years toward vesting. Generally, a plan must preserve the\nservice credit you have accumulated if you leave your employer and then return within fve\nyears. Service credit refers to the years of service that count towards vesting. Because these\nrules are very specifc, you should read your plan document carefully if you are contemplating\na short-term break from your employer, and then discuss it with your plan administrator. If you\nleft employment prior to January 1, 1985, different rules apply.\nIf you retire and later go back to work for a former employer, you must be allowed to continue\nto accrue additional benefts, subject to a plan limit on the total years of service credited under\nthe plan.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nIf you leave an employer before retirement, fnd out whether you can roll your\nbenefts into a new plan or into an IRA.\nIf you leave your benefits in your former employer\u2019s plan, keep your contact\ninformation up to date with the former employer, and keep track of the employer\u2019s\ncontact information.\nIf you are considering taking your benefts as a lump sum, fnd out what taxes and\npenalties you will owe and plan on how you will replace that income in retirement.\n22\nC 6: F C B\nHAPTER ILING A LAIM FOR ENEFITS\nFederal retirement law requires all plans to have a reasonable written procedure for\nprocessing your benefts claim and appeal if your claim is denied. The Summary Plan\nDescription (SPD) should include your plan\u2019s claims procedures. Usually, you fll out the\nrequired paperwork and submit it to the plan administrator, who then can tell you what\nyour benefts will be and when they will start.\nF C F A\nILING A LAIM AND ILING AN PPEAL\nIf there is a problem or a dispute about whether you qualify for benefts or what\namount you should receive, check your plan\u2019s claims procedure. Federal law outlines the\nfollowing claims procedures requirements:\nOnce you fle your claim, the plan can take up to 90 days to reach a decision,\nor 180 days if it notifes you that it needs an extension.\nIf the plan denies your claim, it must send you a written notice, including specifc\ninformation about why your claim was denied and how to fle an appeal.\nYou have 60 days to request a full and fair review of your denied claim, using\nyour plan\u2019s appeals procedure.\nThe plan can take up to 60 days to review your appeal, as well as an additional\n60 days if it notifes you of the need for an extension. The plan must send a\nwritten notice telling you whether the appeal was granted or denied.\nIf the appeal is denied, the written notice must tell you the reason, describe\nany additional appeal levels, and give you a statement about your rights to seek\njudicial review of the plan\u2019s decision.\nIf the plan denies your appeal and you believe it failed to follow ERISA\u2019s\nrequirements, you may decide to seek legal advice. You also can contact the Department\nof Labor about your rights under ERISA electronically or by calling toll free\n1-866-444-3272.\nFor more information on claims procedures, see the Department of Labor\npublication Filing a Claim for Your Retirement Benefits.

These individuals or groups are called plan\nfduciaries. Fiduciary status is based on the functions that the person performs for the\nplan, not just their title.\nD ?\nOES YOUR PLAN HAVE TO IDENTIFY THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR OPERATING THE PLAN\nA plan must name at least one fduciary in the written plan document, or through a\nprocess described in the plan, as having control over the plan\u2019s operations. This fduciary\ncan be identifed by offce or by name. For some plans, it may be an administrative\ncommittee or the company\u2019s board of directors. Usually, a plan\u2019s fduciaries will include\nthe trustee, investment managers, and the plan administrator. The plan administrator is\nusually the best starting point for questions you might have about the plan.\nW ?\nHAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PLAN FIDUCIARIES\nFiduciaries have important responsibilities and are subject to certain standards of\nconduct because they act on behalf of the participants in the plan. These responsibilities\ninclude:\nActing solely in the interest of plan participants and their benefciaries, with\nthe exclusive purpose of providing benefts to them;\nCarrying out their duties with skill, prudence, and diligence;\nFollowing the plan documents (unless inconsistent with ERISA);\nDiversifying plan investments;\nPaying only reasonable expenses of administering the plan and investing its\nassets; and\nAvoiding conficts of interest.\nThe fduciary also is responsible for selecting the investment providers and the\ninvestment options, and for monitoring their performance. Some plans, such as most 401(k)\nor proft sharing plans, can be set up to permit participants to choose the investments\nin their accounts (within certain investment options provided by the plan). If the plan is\nproperly set up to give participants control over their investments, then the fduciary is\nnot liable for losses resulting from the participant\u2019s investment decisions. Department\nof Labor rules provide guidance to make sure participants have suffcient information on\ntheir investment options so they can make informed decisions. This information includes:\nA description of each investment option, including the investment goals, risk,\nand return characteristics;\nInformation about any designated investment managers;\nAn explanation of when and how to request changes in investments, plus any\nrestrictions on when you can change investments;\n25\nA statement of the fees that may be charged to your account when you change\ninvestment options or buy and sell investments;\nThe name, address, and telephone number of the plan fduciary or other person\ndesignated to provide certain additional information on request; and\nA statement that the plan intends to follow the Department of Labor rules and that\nthe fduciaries may be relieved of liability for losses that are the direct and necessary\nresult of a participant\u2019s investment instructions.\nFor an automatic enrollmen t plan, such as an automatic enrollment 401(k) plan, the plan\nfiduciary selects th e investments for em ployees\u2019 automatic contributions if the employees do\nnot provide direction. If the plan is properly set up, using certain default investments that\ngenerally minimize the risk of large losses and provide long-term growth, and providing notice of\nthe plan\u2019s automatic enrollment process, then the fiduciary may be relieved of liability for\nlosses resulting from investing in these default alternatives. The plan also must provide a br oad\nrange of investments for participants to choose from and information on those investments so\nparticipants can make informed decisions. Department of Labor rules provide guidance on the\ndefault investment alternatives that can be used and the notice and information participants\nmust receive.\nW ?\nHAT IF A PLAN FIDUCIARY FAILS TO CARRY OUT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES\nFiduciaries that do not follow the required standards of conduct may be personally lia ble.\nIf the plan loses money because of a breach of their duties, fiduciaries would have to restore\nthose losses, or any profits received through their improper actions. For example, if an emplo yer\ndoes not forward participants\u2019 401(k) contributions to the plan, they would have to pay back the\ncontributions to the plan as well as any lost earnings, and return any profits they improperly\nreceived. Fiduciaries also can be removed from their positions as fiduciaries if they fail to fol low\nthe standards of conduct.\nW ?\nHEN DOES THE EMPLOYER NEED TO DEPOSIT EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE PLAN\nIf you contribute to your retirement plan through deductions from your paycheck, then the\nemployer must follow certain rules to make sure that it deposits the contributions in a timely\nmanner. The law says that the employer must deposit participant contributions as soon as it\nis reasonably possible to separate them from the company\u2019s assets, but no later than the 15th\nbusiness day of the month following the payday. For small plans (those with fewer than 100\nparticipants), salary reduction contributions deposited with the plan no later than the 7th business day\nfollowing withholding by the employer will be considered contributed in compliance with\nthe law. In the Annual Report (Form 5500), the plan administrator must include information on\nwhether deposits of contributions were made on a timely basis. For more information, see\nthe Department of Labor\u2019s Ten Warning Signs That Your 401(k) Contributions Are Being\nMisused for indicators of possible delays in depositing contributions.\n26\nW \u2019\nHAT ARE THE PLAN FIDUCIARIES OBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE FEES AND EXPENSES PAID BY\n? C ?\nTHE PLAN AN THE PLAN CHARGE MY DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN ACCOUNT FOR FEES\nPlan fduciaries have to consider the fees and expenses paid by your plan for its operations.\nERISA\u2019s fduciary standards, discussed above, mean that fduciaries must:\nEstablish a prudent process for selecting investment alternatives and service providers\nto the plan;\nEnsure that fees paid to service providers and other plan expenses are reasonable in\nlight of the level and quality of services provided;\nSelect prudent and adequately diversifed investment alternatives; and\nMonitor investment alternatives and service providers to see that they continue to be\nappropriate choices.\nThe plan may deduct plan administration and investment fees from your defined\ncontribution plan account, either as a direct charge or indirectly as a reduction of your\naccount\u2019s investment returns. Fees for individual services, such as for processing a loan from\nthe plan or a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (see Chapter 9), also may be charged to\nyour account.\nIf you direct the investments in your account, your plan will provide information about\nyour rights and responsibilities under the plan related to directing them. This includes\nplan and investment-related information, including information about fees and expenses,\nthat you need to make informed decisions about the management of your account. The\ninvestment-related information is provided in a format, such as a chart, that allows for a\ncomparison among the plan\u2019s investment options. The plan should provide this\ninformation before you can direct investments for the first time and annually thereafter\nwith information on the fees and expenses actually paid provided at least quarterly.\nFor more information, see the Department of Labor brochure A Look at 401(k) Plan\nFees.

When a plan\nis terminated, the current employees must become 100 percent vested in their\naccrued benefits. This means you have a right to all the benefits that you have earned\nat the time of plan termination, even benefits in which you were not vested and\nwould have lost if you had left the employer. If there is a partial termination of a\nplan (for example, if your employer closes a particular plant or division that results in\nthe end of employment of a substantial percentage of plan participants), the affected\nemployees must be immediately 100 percent vested to the extent the plan is funded.\nW\nHAT IF YOUR TERMINATED DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY\n?\nTO PAY THE BENEFITS\nThe Federal Government, through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\n(PBGC), insures most private defined benefit plans. For terminated defined benefit\nplans that do not have enough money to pay all of the benefits, the PBGC will\nguarantee the payment of your vested pension benefits up to the limits set by law. For\nfurther information on plan termination guarantees, contact the Pension Benefit\nGuaranty Corporation toll free at 1-800-400-7242, or visit the website.\nW ?\nHAT HAPPENS IF A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN IS TERMINATED\nThe PBGC does not guarantee benefits for defined contribution plans. If you are\nin a defined contribution plan that is in the process of terminating, the plan fiduciaries\nand trustees should maintain the plan until they terminate it and pay out the assets.\nI ?\nS YOUR ACCRUED BENEFIT PROTECTED IF YOUR PLAN MERGES WITH ANOTHER PLAN\nYour plan rules and investment choices likely will change if your company merges\nwith another. Your employer may choose to merge your plan with another plan. If your\nplan is terminated because of the merger, the benefits that you have accrued cannot be\nreduced. You must receive a benefit that is at least equal to what you were entitled to\nbefore the merger. In a defined contribution plan, the value of your account may still\nfluctuate after the merger based on investment performance.\nSpecial rules apply to mergers of multiemployer defined benefit plans, which\ngenerally are under the jurisdiction of the PBGC. Contact the PBGC for further\ninformation.\nW ?\nHAT IF YOUR EMPLOYER GOES BANKRUPT\nGenerally, your retirement assets should not be at risk if your employer declares\nbankruptcy. Federal law requires that retirement plans fund promised benefits\nadequately and keep plan assets separate from the employer\u2019s business assets. The\nfunds must be held in trust or invested in an insurance contract. The employers\u2019\n29\ncreditors cannot make a claim on retirement plan funds. However, you should confirm that\nany contributions your employer deducts from your paycheck are forwarded to the plan\u2019s\ntrust or insurance contract in a timely manner.\nSignificant business events such as bankruptcies, mergers, and acquisitions can result\nin employers abandoning their individual account plans (e.g., 401(k) plans), leaving no\nplan fiduciary to manage it. In this situation, participants often have difficulty in accessing\ntheir earned benefits and have no one to contact with questions. Custodians such as banks,\ninsurers, and mutual fund companies are left holding the assets of these plans but do not\nhave the authority to terminate the plans and distribute the assets. In response, the\nDepartment of Labor issued rules to create a voluntary process for the custodian to wind\nup the plan\u2019s business so that benefit distributions can be made and the plan\nterminated. Information about this program can be found on the Department of Labor\u2019s\nwebsite.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nIf your former employer has gone out of business, arrangements should have been\nmade so a plan official remains responsible for the payment of benefits and other\nplan business. If you are entitled to benefits and are unable to contact the plan\nadministrator, contact EBSA electronically or by calling toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nKeep a file with information on your plan and company. If the company no longer\nexists under its former name, you might find some information on the Internet by\nentering the former name in a search engine. If your plan is abandoned, use the\nsearch function on the EBSA website to find out if the plan\u2019s custodian is terminating\nthe plan and the custodian\u2019s co ntact information.\nIf your plan merges, make sure you read the communications about changes in your\nplan, including changes in benefits and investment choices.\nIf your retirement benefit remains with a former employer, keep current on any\nchanges your former employer makes, including changes of address, mergers, or\nemployer name.\nIf you move, give the plan your new contact information.\n30\nC 9: P C A Y B\nHAPTER OTENTIAL LAIMS GAINST OUR ENEFIT\n(D )\nIVORCE\nYour retirement plan generally is safe from claims by other people. Creditors to\nwhom you owe money cannot make a claim against your funds in a retirement plan. For\nexample, if you leave your employer and transfer your 401(k) account into an individual\nretirement account (IRA), creditors generally cannot get access to those IRA funds even\nif you declare bankruptcy.\nFederal law does make an exception for family support and the division of property\nat divorce. For many workers, retirement savings is one of their most signifcant assets.\nFor this reason, whether and how to divide a participant\u2019s interest in a retirement plan\nare often important considerations in separation, divorce, and other domestic relations\nproceedings. While state domestic relations law generally governs the division of marital\nproperty, any assignments of retirement benefts also must comply with Federal law,\nspecifcally ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.\nA state court can award part or all of a participant\u2019s retirement beneft to the spouse,\nformer spouse, child, or other dependent. The recipient named in the order is called\nthe alternate payee. The court issues a specifc order, called a domestic relations order,\nwhich can be in the form of a state court judgment, decree or order, or court approval\nof a property settlement agreement. The order must relate to child support, alimony, or\nmarital property rights, and must be made under state domestic relations law.\nThe plan administrator determines if the order is a qualifed domestic relations order\n(QDRO) under the plan\u2019s procedures and then notifes the participant and the alternate\npayee.\nTo be a QDRO, the order must contain the following information:\nThe participant\u2019s name and last known mailing address;\nThe name and last known mailing address of each alternate payee;\nThe name of the plan;\nThe amount, percentage, or method of determining the amount or percentage of\nthe beneft to be paid to the alternate payee, and\nThe number of payments or time period to which the order applies.\nThe specific content of the rest of the order will depend on the type of retirement\nplan, the nature of the participant\u2019s benefits, the purpose for issuing the order, and the\nintent of the parties drafting the order . A QDRO must provide for a type or form of bene fit\nthat the plan already allows. It cannot require the plan to provide increased benefits. In\ngeneral, a QDRO may assign survivor benefits to a former spouse. Participants and\nalternate payees drafting a QDRO should read the plan\u2019s summary plan description and\nother plan documents to understand the survivor benefits available under the plan. A\nQDRO cannot require a plan to pay benefits to an alternate payee that, under a QDRO\npreviously recognized by the plan, must be paid to another alternate payee.\nIf the participant is still employed, a QDRO can require payment to the alternate payee to\nbegin on or after the participant\u2019s earliest possible retirement age under the plan.\nThese rules apply to both defined benefit and defined contribution plan s.\nFor additional information, see EBSA\u2019s publication, QDROs \u2013 The Division of Retireme nt\n31\nBenefits Through Qualified Domestic Relations Orders. To order a copy, contact\nEBSA electronically or call toll free 1-866-444-3272.\nA I\nCTION TEM\nIf you are getting a divorce, you should discuss these issues with your plan\nadministrator and your attorney.\n32\nC 10: W D I Y H P\nHAPTER HAT TO O F OU AVE A ROBLEM\nSometimes, retirement plan administrators, managers, and others involved with the\nplan make mistakes. Some examples include:\nYour 401(k) or individual account statement is consistently late or comes at\nirregular intervals;\nYour account balance does not appear to be accurate;\nYour employer fails to transmit your contribution to the plan on a timely basis;\nYour plan administrator does not give or send you a copy of the Summary Plan\nDescription; or\nYour beneft is calculated incorrectly.\nIt is important to know that employers are prohibited by law from fring or disciplining\nemployees to avoid paying a beneft, as a reprisal for exercising any of the rights provided\nunder a plan or Federal retirement law (ERISA), or for giving information or testimony in\nany ERISA-related inquiry or proceeding.\nS /\nTART WITH YOUR EMPLOYER AND OR PLAN ADMINISTRATOR\nIf you fnd an error or have a question, you can start by looking for information in\nyour Summary Plan Description. In addition, you can contact your employer and/or the\nplan administrator and ask them to explain what has happened and/or make a correction.\nI ERISA?\nS IT POSSIBLE TO SUE UNDER\nYes, you have a right to sue your plan and its fduciaries to enforce or clarify your\nrights under ERISA and your plan in the following situations:\nTo appeal a denied claim for benefts after exhausting your plan\u2019s claims review\nprocess;\nTo recover benefts due to you;\nTo clarify your right to future benefts;\nTo obtain plan documents that you previously requested in writing but did\nnot receive;\nTo address a breach of a plan fduciary\u2019s duties; or\nTo stop the plan from continuing any act or practice that violates the terms of\nthe plan or ERISA.\nW L D ?\nHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE ABOR EPARTMENT\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Employee Benefts Security Administration (EBSA)\nenforces the ERISA provisions governing the conduct of plan fduciaries, the investment\nand protection of plan assets, the reporting and disclosure of plan information, and\nparticipants\u2019 beneft rights and responsibilities.\nHowever, ERISA does not cover all retirement plans. For example, it does not cover\nFederal, state, or local government plans and some church plans.\n33\nThe Department of Labor enforces the law by informally resolving beneft disputes,\nconducting investigations, and seeking correction of violations of the law, including bringing\nlawsuits when necessary.\nThe Department has benefts advisors who provide individual assistance to participants and\nbenefciaries. Participants will receive information on their rights and responsibilities under\nthe law and help in obtaining benefits to which they are entitled.\nContact a benefits advisor electronically or by calling toll fr ee 1-866-444-3272.\nA I\nCTION TEMS\nContact EBSA for questions about ERISA, help in obtaining a beneft, or:\nIf you believe your claim to benefts has been unjustly denied or that your beneft\nwas calculated incorrectly;\nIf you have information that plan assets are being mismanaged or misused;\nIf you think the plan fduciaries are acting improperly; or\nIf you think your employer has been late in depositing your contributions (see\nChapter 7).\nW F ?\nHAT OTHER EDERAL AGENCIES CAN ASSIST PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES\nThe Pension Beneft Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a federally created corporation that\nguarantees payment of certain pension benefts under most private defned beneft plans when\nthey are terminated with not enough money to pay benefts.\nYou may contact the PBGC at:\nPension Beneft Guaranty Corporation\nPO Box 151750\nAlexandria, VA 22315-1750\nToll-free number: 1-800-400-7242\nmypension@PBGC.gov\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s Internal Revenue Service is responsible for the rules that allow\nretirement plan-related tax benefts for both employees and employers, including vesting and\ndistribution requirements.\n34\nG\nLOSSARY\n401(k) Plan \u2013 In this type of defined contribution plan, the employee can contribute from\ntheir paycheck before taxes are taken out. The contributions go into a 401(k) account, with the\nemployee often choosing the investments based on options provided under the p lan.\nIn some plans, the employer also contributes, matching the employee\u2019s contributions up\nto a certain percentage. SIMPLE and safe harbor 401(k) plans have additional employer\ncontribution and vesting requirements.\nAutomatic Enrollment \u2013 Employers can automatically enroll employees in a plan, suc h as a\n401(k) or SIMPLE IRA plan, and place contributions deducted from employees\u2019 paycheck s into\ncertain predetermined investments, unless the employees decide otherwise. Participants can\nopt out of participation and have periodic opportunities to change their investments\n(or in a SIMPLE IRA, the financial institution where the contributions are invested).\nBenefit Accrual \u2013 The amount of benefits accumulated under the plan.\nCash Balance Plan \u2013 A type of defined benefit plan that includes some elements that are\nsimilar to a defined contribution plan because the benefit amount is computed based on\na formula using contribution and earning credits, and each participant has a hypothetical\naccount. Cash balance plans are more likely than traditional defined benefit plans to\nmake lump sum distributions. (For more information, see Cash Balance Pension Pl ans:\nQuestions and Answers.)\nDefined Benefit Pl an \u2013 This type of plan, also known as the traditional pension plan,\npromises the participant a specified monthly benefit at retirement. The benefit often is\nbased on factors such a s your salary, your age, and the number of years you worked for the\nemployer.\nDefined Contribution Plan \u2013 In a defined contribution plan, the employee and/or the\nemployer contribute to the employee\u2019s individual plan account. The employee often decides\nhow their account is invested. The value of the account will change based on the value and\nperformance of the investments. The amount in the account at distribution includes the\ncontributions and investment gains or losses, minus any investment and administrative fees.\nThe contributions and earnings are not taxed until distribution.\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) \u2013 A Federal law that sets\ns tandards of protection for individuals in most voluntarily established, private-sector\nretirement plans. ERISA:\nRequires plans to provide plan information to participants, including important facts\nabout plan features and funding;\nSets minimum standards for participation, vesting, benefit accrual, and funding;\nProvides fiduciary responsibilities for those who manage and control plan assets;\nRequires plans to establish a claims and appeals process for participants to\nget benefits from their plans;\n35\nGives participants the right to sue for benefts and breaches of fduciary duty; and,\nIf a defned beneft plan is terminated, guarantees payment of certain benefts through\na Federally chartered corporation, known as the Pension Beneft Guaranty Corporation\n(PBGC).\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) \u2013 A type of defned contribution plan that is invested\nprimarily in employer stock.\nIndividual Beneft Statement \u2013 An individual beneft statement provides information about\na participant\u2019s retirement benefts, such as the total plan benefts earned and vested benefts,\non a periodic basis. Additional information may be included depending upon the type of plan,\nsuch as how a participant\u2019s 401(k) plan account is invested and the value of those investments.\nIndividual Retirement Account (IRA) \u2013 An individual account set up with a fnancial institution,\nsuch as a bank or a mutual fund company. Under Federal law, individuals may set aside personal\nsavings up to a certain amount, and the investments grow, tax deferred. In addition, defned\ncontribution plan participants can transfer money from an employer retirement plan to an IRA\nwhen leaving an employer. IRAs can be part of an employer plan.\nMoney Purchase Plan \u2013 A money purchase plan requires set annual contributions from the\nemployer to individual accounts and is subject to other rules.\nMultiemployer Plan \u2013 A retirement plan sponsored by several employers under collective\nbargaining agreements that meets certain other requirements. A participant who changes jobs\nfrom one sponsoring employer to another stays in the same plan.\nPlan Administrator \u2013 The person identifed in the plan document as having responsibility for\nrunning the plan. It could be the employer, a committee of employees, a company executive,\nor someone hired for that purpose.\nPlan Document \u2013 A written instrument under which the plan is established and operated.\nPlan Fiduciary \u2013 Anyone who exercises discretionary authority or discretionary control over\nmanagement or administration of the plan, exercises any authority or control over management\nor disposition of plan assets, or gives investment advice about plan assets for a fee or other\ncompensation.\nPlan Trustee \u2013 Someone who has the exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control\nthe assets of the plan. The trustee can be subject to the direction of a named fduciary and the\nnamed fduciary can appoint one or more investment managers for the plan\u2019s assets.\nPlan Year \u2013 A 12-month period designated by a retirement plan for calculating vesting and\ndistribution, among other things. The plan year can be the calendar year or an alternative\nperiod, e.g., July 1 to June 30.\n36\nProft Sharing Plan \u2013 A proft sharing plan allows the employer each year to determine how\nmuch to contribute to the plan (out of profts or otherwise) in cash or employer stock. The plan\ncontains a formula for allocating the annual contribution among participants.\nRollover \u2013 A rollover occurs when a participant leaves an employer and directs the defned\ncontribution plan to transfer the money in their account to a new plan or individual retirement\naccount. This preserves the benefts and does not trigger any tax consequences if done in a\ntimely manner.\nSafe Harbor 401(k) \u2013 A safe harbor 401(k) is similar to a traditional 401(k) plan, but the\nemployer is required to make contributions for each employee. The employer contributions\nin safe harbor 401(k) plans are immediately 100 percent vested. The safe harbor 401(k) eases\nadministrative burdens on employers by eliminating some of the complex tax rules ordinarily\napplied to traditional 401(k) plans.\nSavings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers (SIMPLE) \u2013 A plan in\nwhich a small business with 100 or fewer employees can offer retirement benefts through\nemployee salary reductions and matching contributions (similar to a 401(k) plan). It can be\neither a SIMPLE IRA or a SIMPLE 401(k). SIMPLE IRA plans impose few administrative burdens\non employers because employees own the IRAs, and the bank or fnancial institution receiving\nthe funds does most of the paperwork. While each has some different features, including\ncontribution limits and the availability of loans, required employer contributions are immediately\n100 percent vested in both.\nSimplifed Employee Pension (SEP) Plan \u2013 A plan in which the employer makes contributions\non a tax-favored basis to employee-owned individual retirement accounts (IRAs). If certain\nconditions are met, the employer is not subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements\nof most retirement plans. Under a SEP, an IRA is set up by or for an employee to accept the\nemployer\u2019s contributions.\nSummary Plan Description \u2013 A document provided by the plan administrator that includes\na plain-language description of important features of the plan, such as:\nWhen employees begin to participate in the plan,\nHow service and benefts are calculated,\nWhen benefts become vested,\nWhen and how payment is received, and\nHow to fle a claim for benefts.\nParticipants must be informed of material changes either through a revised Summary Plan\nDescription or in a separate document called a Summary of Material Modifcations.\nVested Benefts \u2013 Those benefts that the individual has earned a right to receive and that\ncannot be forfeited.\nYears of Service \u2013 The time an individual has worked in a job covered by the plan. It is used\nto determine when an individual can participate and vest and how they can accrue benefts in\nthe plan.\n37\nSeptember 2021"
